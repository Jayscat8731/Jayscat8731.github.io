        <p>so our next speaker is John klauser he was born in Pasadena
California Us in 1942. he studied undergraduate physics at Caltech and
Colombia University New York and received a PhD in physics from Columbia
University in 1969 from 1969 to 1997 he worked at University of
California Berkeley Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and Lawrence
leave them all National Laboratory he&apos;s pressed presently research
physicist at his own private lab in Walnut Creek California so please
join me in welcoming John closer to the stage to tell us about the
development that led to this year&apos;s price oops no wait a minute poof I&apos;m
not I&apos;m not connected no that&apos;s we&apos;re not something is not right uh let
me start over again then here okay okay uh what I did in all of this was
the first experiments to actually uh test what uh John Bell had shown us
was probably one of the most important uh discoveries I I would think of
uh the recent decade or the recent Century if in fact the so these are
so I will discuss the experiments and then a in order to understand the
experiments Mike horn and I developed what&apos;s now called the theory of
local realism which is in essence Einstein&apos;s whole program for uh doing
physics and unfortunately it&apos;s wrong which is what the experiments show
and finally I will end with the uh does this work yeah uh discussion of
why I still am totally confused about what&apos;s going on with quantum
mechanics okay let me start with question is what is quantum mechanic
what is quantum entanglement okay uh quantum entanglement uh started out
with Schrodinger Schrodinger produced not one but two important
equations you started out with the first uh equation which was for
single particles the particular hydrogen which has a single electron and
he miraculously it described the structure the structure and the energy
levels of hydrogen but more complicated was helium which had two
electrons so he produces a a a second uh equation which now involves two
electrons the two are very different equations the second one allows
quantum entanglement which is a new equate uh Solutions emerged from
from the second equation and the peculiarity is that the two electrons
are now intimately uh correlated at the time nobody suggested doing any
experiments to test this rather bizarre prediction however both Einstein
and Schrodinger were very disturbed by this phenomenon and in fact uh
Einstein badalski Rosen in 35 proposed the addition of additional
variables through quantum mechanics to in order to explain what&apos;s going
on Niels Bohr on the other hand said no they&apos;re not needed and and I
discussed all of this very nicely so one of the question first questions
I was asked when I was talking about this in the uh Swedish Embassy uh a
couple of weeks ago was what is a bell inequality this is what we in
fact uh tested there&apos;s not one but there&apos;s actually three important bill
inequalities that I want to talk about the first of course was John
Bell&apos;s 1964 inequality but uh uh and I&apos;ll described very nicely there&apos;s
one problem with being of the theory in order to be useful a theory must
make an experimental prediction and unfortunately uh John Bell&apos;s uh uh
paper made no experimental predictions because it made demanded a
perfect experiment and uh which which had certain uh certainty in the
outcomes and as uh Ben Franklin pointed about the only thing certain in
life are or in nature are death and taxes unfortunately this is not
Texas so the uh uh with uh help from uh my associates uh Mike Horn uh
admir shimone and Dick Holt who is here in the in the audience uh uh
We&apos;ve uh produced the uh closer horns for money Holt now commonly
referred to as chsh inequality which was made the uh first real testable
experimental prediction so and we proposed a detailed experiment to do
that and we noticed various important loopholes uh one of which of
course was mentioned that he tested but a very important loophole was
that the data really couldn&apos;t violate the inequality on their own so we
had to add some additional assumptions so the third inequality is now uh
the was uh produced by Mike horn and I uh in 1974 and it is the first
loophole free experimentally testable uh uh inequality okay let&apos;s start
with the first one uh Atlanta&apos;s already noticed this I signed panelski
Rosen had always and and others had always assumed that that quantum
mechanics always made uh correct predictions the grand irony of this
Bell&apos;s paper is that he showed that Einstein&apos;s original intent of that
paper was exactly the opposite of what was true that the if they wanted
to show that that the correct predictions led to uh the need for hidden
variables and what bell showed was that if you put it hidden variables
in then you can&apos;t get the uh predictions of quantum mechanics so again I
said it was not really testable so uh chsh in 1969 we were inspired by
this work and said wondered well this can we really relieve the get rid
of Einstein&apos;s requirement for a perfect experiment and indeed we found
yes we could and so we designed an experiment uh to actually test it we
worked out all the details of what you uh you needed to do in order to
test it uh and that was the first actual hard experimental prediction uh
and it doesn&apos;t you require uh bills uh impossible to achieve its
conditions so uh we now have two theories two different sets of
predictions quantum mechanics and bills uh the CH inequalities
prediction so being an experimentalist let&apos;s actually do an experiment
and find out which one is true so in order to do this we had to add a
minor supplementary conditions but they were we believe that they&apos;re of
quite reasonable rather weak Okay the third inequality is the CH or the
closer horn inequality that was developed in 1974 uh and it was to test
uh what is now called local realism we wanted to we wondered when we
were doing the experiments we wondered what is really being tested here
is it just the addition of hidden variables or is it something more
profound than that and we found that indeed it is far more profound it
was a test of Einstein&apos;s whole platform for doing physics that we
effectively were putting him out of business and so when we and in fact
the theory when we develop it was effectively Dead on Arrival it was
already refuted but nonetheless we tried to put it in as clear as
possible set of terms as we could so and in the process we formatted a
new inequality the CH inequality and it allows loophole free tests so uh
now if with some even milder additional assumptions then the first
experiments that uh that I had done uh 72 and 76 uh actually knocked it
out so that it was already dead more recently and it&apos;s taken a long time
because the technology did not exist at all to in order to test it in
1974. uh it has now been tested conclusively with so now without any
loopholes at all one can say uh and I agree with the last early uh
conclusion it&apos;s dead Jim so what are some of the experiments uh there
are three important ones that that I did uh first was with Stu Friedman
who was a graduate student at UC Berkeley in 19 uh we published a
results in 1972 and this was the the first experiment to actually test
the chsh inequality in the in parallel with us as Nicole I mentioned who
is here was working with Frank Pipkin at Harvard and they got the
opposite result oops one of us is is in trouble so they decided not to
publish they were skeptical of their results but now I&apos;m skeptical of my
results so uh what do I do well I just decided Well I needed to uh
repeat uh their version of the experiment which I did in 1976. and then
there&apos;s just along the way one of our assumptions had uh and I was kind
of searching for loopholes uh had required photons to act like particles
but I discovered that there was no actual experimentals uh proof that
that particles that photons did act like particles so I did an
experiment 74 to prove that okay so here is the the first experiment a
picture of it and that all at the uh right in it was a very young Stu
Friedman uh in the middle is a the atomic beam apparatus sitting there
pumping away oil leaking all over the floor pair of polarizers on each
side which would which would rotate so and this one became a stu
Friedman&apos;s PhD thesis at uh uh Cal Berkeley so what we did is we had a
calcium Atomic beam and we excited it with this UV lab very weak
extension we wished we&apos;d had lasers which didn&apos;t exist at the time so uh
we got 6.3 Sigma result I mean the five Sigma uh Criterion that is now
common was invented by Louis Alvarez at Berkeley and he he uh was a a
strong Taskmaster on any experimental results that came out of Berkeley
so this was the the second experiment which I did I mentioned uh this
was a repeat of the whole uh Pipkin experiment I use the same polarizers
but I used their uh uh Source uh of mercury uh foreign the two photons
and Dick Hort uh hold uh very generously taught me how to do it uh could
not uh there&apos;s a it&apos;s not an easy and that is my Nobel artifact that I
have donated is one of the the sources so it used Mercury uh with an
electron beam exciting yeah the atoms and I got at least a four Sigma
result there and we use this the same protocol in order to uh introduce
the the assumptions so the other experiment that I mentioned had to deal
with it did particles was there a real way experimentally demonstrated
wave particle duality for photons photons started in 1917 when Einstein
was trying to explain how do does a gas and a thermal uh applied
spectrum of Life come to equilibrium thermal equilibrium with each other
and he noticed that photons had to be behave by what he called
directional energy bundles uh we now call them photons then Schrodinger
noticed that what&apos;s the difference between asking the question well
what&apos;s the difference between a particle and a wave well a a wave could
be just as a classical pulse of light and that is commonly referred to
as the old Schrodinger uh interpretation so how does one tell tell them
apart suppose you have a source and you send light through a half silver
mirror if it&apos;s a wave the wave will go both ways reduced intensity if
it&apos;s a particle the particle will go one way or the other now if I have
two detectors behind the uh the half silvered mirror if it&apos;s a wave they
will both see this pulse and there will be finite a probability that
both will register simultaneously if it&apos;s a particle only one of them so
how does one uh do that uh so actually Schrodinger suggested this and
yannisi and uh Budapest actually tried it but unfortunately they put in
did an inconclusive experiment so I went back and started figured out
how did one do it totally conclusively and uh so I did it actually where
you&apos;re using the the same source that are used for the uh producing the
for the Mercury uh bellotherm experiment uh who had photons going in
both ways and two half silver mirrors and using some a work front by uh
Glover&apos;s formulation what could show that&apos;s the The Coincidence rate
between here and here there should be none of course if if it&apos;s a
particle but but there should be an anomalous if it&apos;s a wave uh a
coincidence rate the product of these two coincidence rates here and
here uh must be greater than the the uh Pro uh the product of these
coincidence rates and so here&apos;s the data and it&apos;s quite the opposite by
about uh 20 Sigma so indeed particles to do act uh photons do act like
particles so as I mentioned before Mike horn and I were trying to
understand what it is that Bell&apos;s theorem experiments actually say so we
developed What&apos;s called the theory of local realism originally we called
it objective local theories uh in our first paper on it and it&apos;s an
extremely general theory that takes it to account all of the basic uh
elements of Einstein&apos;s platform and uh in along the way we produced the
CH inequality which is actually a hard experimental prediction with no
loopholes we did not have any Assumption of causality which we had
earlier in there was no Behavior requirement for a particle like
Behavior uh and then there was some discussion among various other
workers John Bell and admir shimoni added additional components so
presumably uh it is better called Bill clauser Horn shimoni local
realism it&apos;s very short-lived as I mentioned it was already Dead on
Arrival but that wasn&apos;t good enough it had to really be shown to be dead
with no loopholes to it by testing okay what does it assume localism is
extremely Simple Theory Anton zeilinger and please quote me uh tell me
if if I am misquoting you at one point he had a conference he said if
Belle&apos;s inequality and local over realism had been discovered before
quantum mechanics it is so reasonable it would have been taken as a law
of nature or adapted as a law of nature uh unfortunately it&apos;s wrong so
what does local realism assume it assumes that nature is made out of
stuff um well what is stuff well we we may not even know what it is it
is uh it is what I signed Podolski Rosen referred to as elements of
reality it&apos;s what we call matter or uh uh What uh closer horn called
objects John Bell referred to it as beebles it&apos;s there it&apos;s distributed
throughout space now actually Einstein&apos;s whole program in general as if
any in particular goes a lot further and he said they said says that
well it has a finite mass energy density and it it is that density that
determines the whole geometry of the universe we don&apos;t need that for
local realism all we need is that it&apos;s there so it could it could evolve
stochastically or it could evolve uh deterministically we don&apos;t care
it&apos;s stuff is stuff you can put in a box you could uh throughout it and
it&apos;s the stuff that&apos;s in the Box if you&apos;re doing an experiment the stuff
determines the probabilities of the experiment that you actually do
there we assume that there are Real Results the that happen when you do
an experiment that is uh unlike uh Schrodinger actually he he thought
the whole idea of the The Cat In The Box experiment was a total of
absurdity we assume that the cat is either alive or dead and we just
don&apos;t know which that a real result always occurs presumed that the
properties of the stuff determine the results of an experiment you do
the if you have a parameter setting on your apparatus and then you
change the parameter setting presumably you will get a different result
so what does it predict well suppose you have two very widely separated
boxes each has stuff in it and you&apos;re doing experiments in these two uh
wide separated boxes so you&apos;ve hurt the Assumption the following
Einstein&apos;s uh requirement for locality is that stuff in one box and the
out of the parameter settings uh the result of the experiment in one box
measuring that stuff cannot be influenced by the parameter setting
Choice made in the distant box that&apos;s all you need to produce uh uh the
uh the closer horn inequality okay so here&apos;s what are boxes well they&apos;re
just closed surfaces they separate each closed surface separates has a
an inside and an outside so here we have a pair of boxes okay these
characters are uh well I made that drawing in 1976 uh before the
characters had been named uh Alice and Bob well okay so this but she but
she perhaps trans I don&apos;t know so what uh here we have Alice and Bob
making measurements and they get a result yes no on each side so we have
our boxes here are now shrinking at the speed of light and so there&apos;s
drawn so that we&apos;re doing the experiments when there&apos;s space like
separated so if I plotted versus X and time uh here are the boxes
shrinking uh simultaneously and doing experiments so the assumption is
that stuff back here in the common overlap region is what is the result
of of the extremist if you read some of John Bell&apos;s stuff you have to be
careful for some reason he had these reverse he had the arrow of time
going to the left uh I&apos;m sure he had a reason for it but I don&apos;t know
what it was okay it&apos;s dead Jim I apologize to Star Trek who was for a
long time it was very difficult to do this the technology just simply
did not exist back in 74. but it has improved so it became very
important to eliminate the loopholes in the earlier CH tests of the chsh
inequality and uh to really do a loophole free experiment and finally
most recently at a labs in Vienna and in Champaign Urbana uh Illinois uh
it has been totally killed dead okay now I will use what my time
remaining to make a a value statement if you will about why I have the
fattest idea what&apos;s going on and I argue that in fact there&apos;s been an
elephant in the room pardon the metaphor that has been hanging around
ever since uh Schrodinger and epr remember the trottinger produced two
very different equations he had one for hydrogen with only a single
particle and he had another one for helium which had two particles
nobody seemed concerned at the time about the fact that these two
equations were formulated in very different spaces and they I are what I
believe is improperly linked and I&apos;ll go on to that in a minute by what
I call borns ambiguity born was the one who who said that they are
equivalent and this this has been the elephant&apos;s been hiding in plain
sight and I noticed that in fact the Einstein podolsky Rosen art debate
a bore debate was never really settled various textbook authors believed
one or the other of the authors and they&apos;re developed in the literature
in the textbook industry two very different schools of thought and most
people never seem to notice this but with the Advent of local realism
and quantum entanglement then it became clear that one could actually
contrast and identify these two schools of thought okay School number
one either is essentially a form of local realism so one of the
textbooks that promote uh uh uh the School number one it is what I call
the laboratory space formulation of quantum mechanics okay it was taught
you&apos;re all I kind of cut off the uh the list at about 1980 begin at
first was born born&apos;s textbook two very important uh textbooks uh
familiar Dickie and whitkey and mersbacher were very popular uh all
follow this uh like for example inborn case the waves are propagating in
the lab and he shows pictures of waves moving around all of these books
show waves in the it was propagating through a two-slit experiment in
lab space Feynman uh this is his review article 1948 even puts it into
the title this is a space-time uh operation French French and Taylor uh
using MIT and of course the Original Classic shift okay what is School
number one Quantum Mechanics for single particle systems is formulated
in lab space or real space the XYZ of this room and Heather is a point
every point in this lab space has a vector to it and Schrodinger&apos;s wave
function is a function of its position uh in the room or in the lab and
more importantly the probability density PSI star PSI is a function of
his position in the room it is the evolution of of these waves is
governed by Schrodinger&apos;s equation in lab space and it depicts waves of
probability you&apos;ve probably heard any number of people describe quantum
mechanics says waves the probability moreover there&apos;s also it&apos;s defined
by born a conserved uh probability current which flows like a fluid
through through the lab and he famously used that uh of current to
describe flux conservation frieden Rutherford scattering unfortunately
it only works the slab school of thought number one only works for
single particle systems it cannot describe two particle systems or and
it cannot describe entanglement so what&apos;s goal number two also had a
large group of textbooks which very specifically said we are in
configuration space okay probably one of the most important ones but
beta and saw Peter with the authoritative work on hydrogen and helium
Jordan and Drell relative is a quantum mechanics caught in and shortly
uh calculate Spectra of atoms land down on lift shits great quantum
mechanics to expect it was translated by John Bell actually and
messiah&apos;s famous book uh except he he claims he&apos;s in in configuration
space but actually he cheats a bit and probably most importantly fall
was Von Neumann&apos;s textbook okay what is the configuration space School
of quantum mechanics it is a very very different from what I just
described the wave function depends on A System&apos;s degrees of freedom
this Kim&apos;s there could be many of them uh there could be k degrees of
some large number k and so we have a wave function and these are all
this is straight out of Von Neumann&apos;s uh both so if you have say two
particles in helium then now the argument space of the wave function is
very different it has an x y z of particle one XYZ of particle two wait
our lab does not have six dimensions something has dramatically changed
importantly the position in the lab is not one of the arguments that
means that its value is the same everywhere is base unlike the lab space
formulation that there were it&apos;s different every point in space so
Schrodinger&apos;s equation now is very different it&apos;s divided describing the
evolution of particles in this configuration space it&apos;s an abstract
mathematical space it is not at all this the space uh that Star Trek was
exploring the a few important and it&apos;s absolutely required if you want
to discuss more than one particle systems borns conserved currents
cannot be drawn in a configuration space Green&apos;s theorem does not apply
more importantly the there is no prohibition for propagation of signals
faster than life in configuration space it&apos;s a purely arbitrary space
totally as fact it&apos;s what the imaginations call a vector space not at
all so it was been asserted and I as far as I could trace back this was
originally to to Bourne&apos;s uh dog that uh these two cases are are the
same they are not clearly the two uh wave functions are very different
they are not equivalent one depends on the position of space one does
not there are no Associated probability waves for configuration space so
for my last slide I will describe why I find this all totally confusing
you gotta have configuration space in order to describe more than one
particle systems but there&apos;s no reason uh that the special case of
signal particle systems should be any different so you need a so and we
notice really that the lab space formulation is uh really a form of
local realism it&apos;s dead Jim so now all of these great models conceptual
models of probability waves propagating in space are also dead the flow
of currents probability currents are dead I don&apos;t know how to visualize
propagation in configuration space there are a lot of people here who
know a lot more quantum mechanics than I do and maybe one of them will
help me understand what does it mean to have a way of propagating and
configuration space I don&apos;t know uh thinking Wiki and Bruce bucker were
on my side they both said gave up and said oh gee this is all our our
great models i.ei earlier uh sections of the book we really should throw
throw away so I have one final challenge to my theorist friends if I
still have any remember we said that that general relativity uh is a
form of local realism so and it is a general relativity that for example
gives us black holes so but that&apos;s all formulated in under a local
realism Theory so my challenge is to the theorists is it possible to
have two entangled black hole spins thank you</p>

<p>hi and welcome to crash course u.s history a course that
approximately follows the ap u.s history curriculum as it appeared in
2013 and even though we call it u.s history we do begin before any
europeans show up in north america from the 15th century we&apos;ll take you
through every beat of the country&apos;s history until we reach barack
obama&apos;s presidency this will include all the well-known events we&apos;ll
learn about the revolutionary war the civil war women&apos;s suffrage the
world wars civil rights and so on but we&apos;ll introduce you to some
lesser-known events and people as well we&apos;ll do that via primary sources
that do a deep dive into how people were reacting to the time period
they were living through we&apos;ll also consider who was given the privilege
to have their reactions recorded because when citizens are marginalized
based on class gender or race that history isn&apos;t just history it touches
every part of the present so we&apos;ll learn it all together and try to make
sense of the united states complicated history oh and if jon gets the
mystery document wrong he&apos;ll be shocked literally.</p>
<h2 id="section">1</h2>
<p>Hi I&apos;m John Green, and this is Crash Course U.S. History!</p>
<p>No, Stan. That&apos;s not gonna work, actually.</p>
<p>I mean, we&apos;re talking about the 16th century today,when this was
neither united nor states.</p>
<p>By the way, this globe reflects the fact that I believe that Alaskan
statehood is illegitimate!</p>
<p>In fact, we&apos;re going to call this whole show &quot;U.S. History&quot;</p>
<p>but inevitably it is going to involve other parts of the world and
also, not to brag, a small part of the moon.</p>
<p>Sorry, we can be a little bit self-aggrandizing sometimes, here in
America.</p>
<p>So to begin U.S. history, we&apos;re not going to talk about the United
states or this guy.</p>
<p>We&apos;re going to talk about the people who lived here before any
Europeans showed up.</p>
<p>North America was home to a great variety of people so it&apos;s difficult
to generalize, but here&apos;s what we can say:</p>
<p>One, when the Europeans arrived there were no classical-style
civilizations with monumental architecture and empires like the Aztec or
the Incas.</p>
<p>And two, native North Americans had no metalwork, no gun powder, no
wheels, no written languages, and no domesticated animals.</p>
<p>However, they did have farming, complex social and political
structures, and widespread trade networks.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Mr. Green! Mr. Green! So they were pretty backwards, huh? Well, or I
mean at least primitive.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Primitive&quot; is a funny word, me from the past, because it implies a
romanticization --</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>these simple people who never used more than they needed and had no
use for guns. And it also implies an infantilization. It&apos;s like you
believe just because you have a beeper and they didn&apos;t they were somehow
less-evolved humans. But you can&apos;t see the human story as one that goes
from primitive to civilized. That&apos;s not just Eurocentric that&apos;s
contemporary-centric. The idea that we&apos;re moving forward as a species
implies a linear progression that just does not reflect the reality of
life on this planet. I get that you like to imagine yourself as the
result of millennia of advancement and the very pinnacle of human-ness,
but from where I&apos;m sitting that worldview is a lot more backwards than
living without the wheel. So no one knows exactly how many people lived
in North America before the Europeans got here. Some estimates are as
high as 75 million, but in the present US borders the guesses are
between 2 and 10 million. And like other Native Americans their
populations were decimated by diseases such as smallpox and influenza.
Actually it was much worse than decimation. As many of you have pointed
out, &quot;decimation&quot; means 1 in 10. This was much worse than that. It was
closer maybe to 8 in 10, which would be an &quot;octicimation.&quot; So there had
been civilizations in North America but they peaked before the Europeans
arrived. The Zuni and Hopi civilization roundabout here peaked</p>
<p>about 1200 CE.</p>
<p>They had large, multiple-family dwellings and canyons, which they
probably left because of drought. Crash Course World History fans will
remember that environmental degradation often causes the decline of
civilizations. I&apos;m looking at you, Indus Valley, and also you, entire
future Earth. Eut complex civilizations weren&apos;t the rule in North
America. And now we&apos;re about to begin generalizing, a bad habit
historians have partly because there&apos;s a limited historical record but
also because Eurocentric historians have a bad habit of primitivizing
and simplifying others. So I want to underscore that there was huge
diversity in the pre-Columbus American experience and that talking about
someone who lived here in 1000 BCE and talking about someone who lived
here 2,000 years later is just inherently problematic.</p>
<p>That said, let&apos;s go to the Thought Bubble: Most native groups in most
places organized as tribes, and their lives were dominated by the
natural resources available where they lived. So West Coast Indians
primarily lived by fishing, gathering, and hunting sea mammals; Great
Plains Indians were often buffalo hunters. These tribal bands often
united into loose confederacies or leagues, the best-known of which was
probably the Iroquois Confederacy, also called the Great League of
Peace. This was kind of like an upstate New York version of NATO but
without a nuclear weapons or the incessant international meddling or
Latvians-- Okay, it was nothing like NATO, actually. Religion usually
involved a vibrant spiritual world with ceremonies geared toward the
tribe&apos;s lifestyle: hunting tribes focused on animals, agricultural
tribes on good harvests. And most Indian groups believed in a single
creator god who stood above all the other deities, but they weren&apos;t
monotheistic in the way that Christians who came to the New World were.
American Indians also saw property very differently from Europeans. To
First Peoples, land was a common resource that village leaders could
assign families to use but not to own, and most land was seen as common
to everyone. As Blackhawk, a leader of the Sauk tribe, said, &quot;The Great
Spirit gave it to his children to</p>
<p>live upon and cultivate as far as necessary for their subsistence;
and so long as they occupy and cultivate it, they have a right to the
soil.&quot;</p>
<p>Thanks, Thought Bubble. Many of us tend to romanticize American
Indians as being immune from greed and class, but in fact there were
class distinctions in Indian tribes. Rulers tended to come from the same
families, for instance. That said, wealth was much more evenly
distributed than it was in Europe. And while most tribal leaders were
men, many tribes were matrilineal meaning that children became members
of their mother&apos;s family. Also women were often important religious
leaders. Women also often owned dwellings and tools, although not land
because again that idea did not exist. Also in many tribes women
engaging in premarital skoodilypooping wasn&apos;t taboo. In general they
were just much less obsessed with female chastity than Europeans were. I
mean I will remind you the first English settlement in America was
called &quot;Virginia.&quot; The idea that Native Americans were noble savages,
somehow purer than Europeans and untouched by their vices is not a new
one. Like some of the earliest European saw the Indians as paragons of
physical beauty and innocent of Europeans&apos; worst characteristics. But
for most Europeans there was little noble about what they saw as pure
Indian savagery. I mean Indians didn&apos;t have writing, they suffered from
the terrible character flaw of being able to have sex without feeling
ashamed, and most importantly they weren&apos;t Christians. The Spanish were
the first Europeans to explore this part of the world. Juan Ponce de
Le&#xF3;n arrived in what is now Florida in 1513 looking for gold and the
fabled Fountain of Youth. In 1521 he encountered a Calusa brave&apos;s
poison-tipped arrow and died before discovering that the Fountain of
Youth is of course delicious Diet Dr. Pepper. Mmm, ahh. I can taste all
23 flavors. There were many more Spanish explorers in the first half of
the 16th century including one &#xC1;lvar Nu&#xF1;ez Cabeza de Vaca, who wandered
through the American Southwest looking for gold, which I mentioned
entirely because I think that guy&apos;s last name means &quot;cow head.&quot; Of
course none of these people found any gold, but they did make later
European colonization easier by bringing over the microbes that wiped
out most native populations. So the Spanish wanted to colonize Florida
to set up military bases to thwart the pirates who preyed on
silver-laden Spanish galleons coming out of M&#xE9;xico. But Spanish
missionaries also came over hoping to convert local native populations.
This of course worked out magnificently. Just kidding, it went terribly.
Many of the missions were destroyed by an uprising of Guale Indians in
1597, and I will remind you mispronouncing things is my thing. In
general colonizing Florida sucked because it was hot and mosquito-y.
Spain was much more successful at colonizing the American Southwest. In
1610 Spain established its first permanent settlement in the southwest
at Santa Fe, New M&#xE9;xico. You couldn&apos;t really say that it flourished
since Santa Fe&apos;s population never got much above 3,000, but it had a
great small-town feel. New M&#xE9;xico is really important because it&apos;s the
site of the first large-scale uprising by Native Americans against
Europeans. I mean the native people, who the Spanish called &quot;Pueblos,&quot;
had seen their fortunes decline significantly since the arrival of
Europeans. How much decline? Well, between 1600 and 1680 their
population went from about 60,000 to about 17,000. Also the Franciscan
friars who came to convert the indigenous people became increasingly
militant about stamping out all native religion. The Spanish Inquisition
just wasn&apos;t very keen on the kind of cultural blending that made early
conversion efforts successful. So while the Spanish saw all the Pueblos
as one people they also knew there were tribal differences that made it
difficult for the Indians to unite and rise up against the Spanish. But
nothing unites like a common enemy, and in 1680 a religious leader named
Pop&#xE9; organized an uprising to drive the Spaniards out. Pop&#xE9; organized
about 2,000 warriors, who killed 400 Spanish colonists and forced the
rest to leave Santa Fe. So the Spanish colony in New M&#xE9;xico was
effectively destroyed. The Pueblos tore down all the Christian churches
and replaced them with kivas (their places of worship), but like most
awesome uprisings it didn&apos;t last. After the revolt the Spanish were much
more tolerant of indigenous religion, and they also abandoned the forced
labor practice called encomienda. Oh, it&apos;s time for the new Crash Course
feature the &quot;Mystery Document&quot;? How mysterious. The rules here are
simple: I read an attempt to identify the mystery document. If I am
right, I do not get shocked by this shock pen. And if I am wrong, I do.
Okay, what do we have here? &quot;The Indians were totally deprived of their
freedom and were put in the harshest, fiercest most horrible servitude
and captivity which no one who has not seen it can understand. Even
beasts enjoy more freedom when they are allowed to graze in the fields.
But our Spaniards gave no such opportunity to Indians and truly
considered them perpetual slaves. I sometimes came upon dead bodies on
my way, and upon others who were grasping and moaning in their death
agony repeating, &apos;Hungry, hungry.&apos; Andthis was the freedom, the good
treatment and the Christianity the Indians received.&quot; Well, that&apos;s nice.
Okay, so the mystery document is always a primary source, and since the
writer refers to &quot;our Spaniards&quot; I&apos;m going to guess that he or she
(probably he) is European and a Spaniards sympathetic to the Indians,
which narrows the list of suspects considerably. So it probably wasn&apos;t
de Sep&#xFA;lveda for instance, who argued that the Indians might not even be
human. Okay, Stan I&apos;m actually pretty confident here. I believe it is
from &quot;A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies&quot; by Bartolom&#xE9; de
las Casas. Ah, dang it! Stan just told me I have the author right but
the book wrong. It&apos;s &quot;A History of the Indies.&quot; Oh, I hate shocks, both
literal and metaphorical. So we focused a lot on the brutality of the
Spanish toward the Indians, but at least one Spaniard, de las Casas,
recognized that his countrymen were terrible. This realization is a good
thing, obviously, but it leads us to one of the big problems when it
comes to studying this time and place. The Black Legend is the tale that
the Spanish unleashed unspeakable cruelty on the Indians. Now, that tale
is true. But that idea was used by later settlers, especially the
English, to justify their own settlements. Like part of the reason they
needed to expand their empire was to save the Indians from the awful
Spanish, but were the English so much better? Yeah, probably not. As we
mentioned at the beginning of today&apos;s episode, American Indians didn&apos;t
have writing so we don&apos;t have records of their perspective. Now, some
Europeans like de las Casas were critical of the Spaniards, but most
considered the Indians heathens and implied or even outright said that
they deserved whatever horrible things befell them. So at the beginning
of our series I want to point out something that we need to remember
throughout: One of the great things about American history is that we
have a lot of written sources. This is the advantage of the U.S. coming
onto the scene so late in the game, historically speaking, But every
story we hear comes from a certain point of view. And we always need to
remember who is speaking, why they are speaking, and especially which
voices go unheard and why. Thanks for watching. I&apos;ll see you next
week.</p>
<h1 id="section-1">2</h1>
<p>Hi I&#x2019;m John Green, this is Crash Course US History,</p>
<p>and today we&apos;re going to tell the story of how a group of plucky
English people struck a blow for religious freedom,</p>
<p>and founded the greatest, freest and fattest nation the world has
ever seen.</p>
<p>[Libertage]</p>
<p>These Brits entered a barren land containing no people,</p>
<p>and quickly invented the automobile, baseball and Star Trek and we
all lived happily ever after.</p>
<p>Mr. Green, Mr. Green, if it is really that simple, I am so getting an
A in this class.</p>
<p>Oh, me from the past, you&apos;re just a delight.</p>
<p>[Theme Music]</p>
<p>So most Americans grew up hearing that the United States was founded
by pasty English people</p>
<p>who came here to escape religious persecution.</p>
<p>And that&apos;s true of the small proportion of people who settled in the
Massachusetts Bay</p>
<p>and created what we now know is New England.</p>
<p>But these Pilgrims and Puritans, there&apos;s a difference, weren&#x2019;t the
first people</p>
<p>or even the first Europeans to come to the only part of the globe we
didn&apos;t paint over.</p>
<p>In fact they weren&#x2019;t the first English people.</p>
<p>The first English people came to Virginia.</p>
<p>Off topic but how weird is it that the first permanent English colony
in the Americas was named</p>
<p>not for Queen Elizabeth&#x2019;s epicness but for her supposed chastity.</p>
<p>Right anyway, those first English settlers weren&apos;t looking for
religious freedom, they wanted to get rich.</p>
<p>So the first successful English colony in America was founded in
Jamestown, Virginia in 1607.</p>
<p>I say &quot;successful&quot; because there were two previous attempts to
colonize the region.</p>
<p>They were both epic failures.</p>
<p>The more famous of which was the colony of Roanoke Island set up by
Sir Walter Raleigh,</p>
<p>which is famous because all the colonists disappeared leaving only
the word &quot;Croatoan&quot; on carved into a tree.</p>
<p>Jamestown was a project of the Virginia Company,</p>
<p>which existed to make money for its investors, something it never
did.</p>
<p>The hope was that they would find gold in the Chesapeake region like
the Spanish had in South America,</p>
<p>so there were a disproportionate number of goldsmiths</p>
<p>and jewelers there to fancy up that gold which of course did not
exist.</p>
<p>Anyway, it turns out that jewelers dislike farming --</p>
<p>so much so, that Captain John Smith who soon took over control of the
island once said</p>
<p>that they would rather starve than farm.</p>
<p>So in the first year, half of the colonists died.</p>
<p>400 replacements came, but, by 1610, after a gruesome winter called
&quot;The Starving Time,&quot;</p>
<p>the number of colonists had dwindled to 65.</p>
<p>And eventually word got out that the new world&#x2019;s 1 year survival rate
was</p>
<p>like 20% and it became harder to find new colonists.</p>
<p>But 1618, a Virginia company hit upon a recruiting strategy called
the headright system</p>
<p>which offered 50 acres of land for each person that a settler paid to
bring over.</p>
<p>And this enabled the creation of a number of large estates,</p>
<p>which were mostly worked on and populated by indentured servants.</p>
<p>Indentured servants weren&apos;t quite slaves, but they were kind of
temporary slaves.</p>
<p>Like they could be bought and sold and they had to do what their
masters commanded.</p>
<p>But after seven to ten years of that, if they weren&apos;t dead,</p>
<p>they were paid their freedom dues which they hoped would allow them
to buy farms of their own.</p>
<p>Sometimes that worked out, but often either the money wasn&apos;t enough
to buy a farm,</p>
<p>or else they were too dead to collect it.</p>
<p>Even more ominously in 1619, just 12 years after the founding of
Jamestown,</p>
<p>the first shipment of African slaves arrived in Virginia.</p>
<p>So the colony probably would have continued to struggle along,</p>
<p>if they hadn&apos;t found something that people really loved: tobacco.</p>
<p>Tobacco had been grown in Mexico since at least 1000 BCE,</p>
<p>but the Europeans had never seen it and it proved to be kind of a</p>
<p>&quot;thank you for the small pox; here&apos;s some lung cancer&#x201D; gift from the
natives.</p>
<p>Interestingly King James hated smoking.</p>
<p>He called it &#x201C;a custom loathsome to the eye and hateful to the
nose&quot;</p>
<p>but he loved him some tax revenue, and nothing sells like drugs.</p>
<p>By 1624 Virginia was producing more than 200,000 pounds of tobacco
per year.</p>
<p>By the 1680s, more than 30 million pounds per year.</p>
<p>Tobacco was so profitable the colonists created huge plantations with
very little in the way of towns</p>
<p>or infrastructure to hold the social order together, a strategy that
always works out brilliantly.</p>
<p>The industry also structured Virginian society.</p>
<p>First off, most of the people who came in the 17th century,
three-quarters of them, were servants.</p>
<p>So Virginia became a microcosm of England:</p>
<p>a small class of wealthy landowners sitting atop a mass of
servants.</p>
<p>That sounds kind of dirty but it was mostly just sad.</p>
<p>The society was also overwhelmingly male, because male servants were
more useful in the tobacco fields,</p>
<p>they were the greatest proportion of immigrants.</p>
<p>In fact they outnumbered women 5 to 1.</p>
<p>The women who did come over were mostly indentured servants,</p>
<p>and if they were to marry, which they often did because they were in
great demand,</p>
<p>they had to wait until their term of service was up.</p>
<p>This meant delayed marriage which meant fewer children which further
reduced the number of females.</p>
<p>Life was pretty tough for these women, but on the upside Virginia was
kind of a swamp of pestilence,</p>
<p>so their husbands often died, and that created a small class of
widows or even unmarried women who,</p>
<p>because of their special status, could make contracts and own
property, so that was good, sort of.</p>
<p>OK. A quick word about Maryland.</p>
<p>Maryland was the second Chesapeake Colony, founded in 1632,</p>
<p>and by now there was no messing around with joint stock
companies.</p>
<p>Maryland was a proprietorship: a massive land grant to a single
individual named Cecilius Calvert.</p>
<p>Calvert wanted to turn Maryland into like a medieval feudal kingdom
to benefit himself and his family,</p>
<p>and he was no fan of the representational institutions that were
developing in Virginia.</p>
<p>Also Calvert was Catholic, and Catholics were welcome in Maryland
which wasn&apos;t always the case elsewhere.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, let&apos;s talk about Massachusetts.</p>
<p>So Jamestown might have been the first English colony, but
Massachusetts Bay is probably better known.</p>
<p>This is largely because the colonists who came there were so
recognizable for their beliefs and also for their hats.</p>
<p>That&#x2019;s right. I&#x2019;m talking about the Pilgrims and the Puritans.</p>
<p>And no, I will not be talking about Thanksgiving</p>
<p>...is a lie. I can&#x2019;t help myself.</p>
<p>But only to clear up the difference between Pilgrims and Puritans and
also to talk about Squanto.</p>
<p>God I love me some Squanto. Let&apos;s go to the Thought Bubble.</p>
<p>Most of the English men and women who settled in New England were
uber-Protestant Puritans</p>
<p>who believed the Protestant Church of England was still too
Catholic-y</p>
<p>with its kneeling and incense and extravagantly-hatted
archbishops.</p>
<p>The particular Puritans who, by the way did not call themselves that
-- other people did,</p>
<p>who settled in new England were called Congregationalists</p>
<p>because they thought congregations should determine leadership and
worship structures, not bishops.</p>
<p>The Pilgrims were even more extreme.</p>
<p>They wanted to separate more or less completely from the Church of
England.</p>
<p>So first they fled to the Netherlands, but the Dutch were apparently
too corrupt for them,</p>
<p>so they rounded up investors and financed a new colony in 1620.</p>
<p>They were supposed to land in Virginia, but in what perhaps should
have been taken as an omen,</p>
<p>they were blown wildly off course and ended up in what&apos;s now
Massachusetts, founding a colony called Plymouth.</p>
<p>While still on board their ship the Mayflower,</p>
<p>41 of the 150 or so colonists wrote and signed an agreement called
the Mayflower Compact,</p>
<p>in which they all bound themselves to follow &quot;just and equal laws&quot;
that their chosen representatives would write-up.</p>
<p>Since this was the first written framework for government in the US,
it&apos;s kind of a big deal.</p>
<p>But anyway, the Pilgrims had the excellent fortune of landing in
Massachusetts with 6 weeks before winter,</p>
<p>and they had the good sense not to bring very much food with them or
any farm animals.</p>
<p>Half of them died before winter was out.</p>
<p>The only reason they didn&apos;t all die was that local Indians led by
Squanto gave them food and saved them.</p>
<p>A year later, grateful that they had survived mainly due to the help
of an alliance with the local chief Massasoit,</p>
<p>and because the Indians had taught them how to plant corn and where
to catch fish,</p>
<p>the Pilgrims held a big feast: the first Thanksgiving. Thanks Thought
Bubble!</p>
<p>And by the way, that feast was on the fourth Thursday in
November,</p>
<p>not mid-October as is celebrated in some of these green areas we call
Not America.</p>
<p>Anyway Squanto was a pretty amazing character and not only because he
helped save the Pilgrims.</p>
<p>He found that almost all of his tribe, the Patuxet had been wiped out
by disease</p>
<p>and eventually settled with the Pilgrims on the site of his former
village and then died...</p>
<p>of disease because it is always ruining everything.</p>
<p>So the Pilgrims struggled on until 1691</p>
<p>when their colony was subsumed by the larger and much more successful
Massachusetts Bay Colony.</p>
<p>The Massachusetts Bay colony was chartered in 1629 by London
merchants who,</p>
<p>like the founders of the Virginia Company, hoped to make money.</p>
<p>But unlike Virginia, the board of directors relocated from England to
America,</p>
<p>which meant that in Massachusetts they had a greater degree of
autonomy and self-government than they did in Virginia.</p>
<p>Social unity was also much more important in Massachusetts than it
was in Virginia.</p>
<p>The Puritans&apos; religious mission meant that the common good was, at
least at first,</p>
<p>put above the needs or the rights of the individual.</p>
<p>Those different ideas in the North and South about the role of
government would continue...until now.</p>
<p>Oh God. It&apos;s time for the mystery document?</p>
<p>The rules are simple. I read the mystery document which I have not
seen before.</p>
<p>If I get it right, then I do not get shocked with the shock pen, and
if I get it wrong I do.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>&quot;We must be knit together in this work as one man, we must entertain
each other in brotherly affection,</p>
<p>we must be willing to abridge ourselves of our superfluities
(su-per-fluities? I don&apos;t know),</p>
<p>for the supply of others necessities,</p>
<p>we must uphold a familiar commerce together in all meekness,
gentleness, patience and liberality,</p>
<p>...for we must consider that we shall be as a city upon a hill, the
eyes of all people are upon us;</p>
<p>so that if we shall deal falsely with our god in this work we have
undertaken</p>
<p>and so cause him to withdraw his present help from us,</p>
<p>we shall be made a story and a byword through the world.&quot;</p>
<p>Alright, first thing I noticed: the author of this document is a
terrible speller</p>
<p>or possibly wrote this before English was standardized.</p>
<p>Also, a pretty religious individual.</p>
<p>And the community in question seems to embrace something near
socialism:</p>
<p>abridging the superfluous for others&apos; necessities.</p>
<p>Also it says that the community should be like a city upon a hill,
like a model for everybody.</p>
<p>And because of that metaphor, I know exactly where it comes from:</p>
<p>the sermon &quot;A Model of Christian Charity&quot; by John Winthrop.</p>
<p>Yes! Yes! No punishment!</p>
<p>This is one of the most important sermons in American history.</p>
<p>It shows us just how religious the Puritans were,</p>
<p>but it also shows us that their religious mission wasn&apos;t really one
of individualism but of collective effort.</p>
<p>In other words, the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few
or the one.</p>
<p>But this city on a hill metaphor is the basis for one kind of
American exceptionalism:</p>
<p>the idea that we are so special and so godly that we will be a model
to other nations,</p>
<p>at least as long, according to Winthrop, as we act together.</p>
<p>Lest you think Winthrop&#x2019;s words were forgotten,</p>
<p>they did become the centerpiece of Ronald Reagan&#x2019;s 1989 farewell
address.</p>
<p>Okay so New England towns were governed democratically,</p>
<p>but that doesn&apos;t mean that the Puritans were big on equality</p>
<p>or that everybody was able to participate in government because
no.</p>
<p>The only people who could vote or hold office were church
members,</p>
<p>and to be a full church member you had to be a &#x201C;visible saint&quot;,</p>
<p>so really, power stayed in the hands of the church elite. The same
went for equality.</p>
<p>While it was better than in the Chesapeake Colonies or England, as
equality went...eh, pretty unequal.</p>
<p>As John Winthrop declared, &quot;Some must be rich, and some poor.</p>
<p>Some high, an eminent in power, and dignity; others mean and in
subjection.&quot;</p>
<p>Or as historian Eric Foner put it</p>
<p>&quot;Inequality was considered an expression of God&apos;s will and while some
liberties applied to all inhabitants,</p>
<p>there were separate lists of rights for freemen, women, children and
servants.&quot;</p>
<p>There was also slavery in Massachusetts. The first slaves were
recorded in the colony in 1640.</p>
<p>However, Puritans really did foster equality in one sense.</p>
<p>They wanted everyone to be able to read the Bible.</p>
<p>In fact, parents could be punished by the town councils for not
properly instructing</p>
<p>their children in making them literate.</p>
<p>But when Roger Williams called for citizens to be able to practice
any religion they chose,</p>
<p>he was banished from the colonies.</p>
<p>So was Ann Hutchinson who argued the church membership should be
based on inner grace</p>
<p>and not on outward manifestations like church attendance.</p>
<p>Williams went on to found Rhode Island, so that worked out fine for
him,</p>
<p>but Hutchinson, who was doubly threatening to Massachusetts</p>
<p>because she was a woman preaching unorthodox ideas,</p>
<p>was too radical and was further banished to Westchester, New York
where she and her family were killed by Indians.</p>
<p>Finally, somebody who doesn&apos;t die of disease or starvation.</p>
<p>So Americans like to think of their country as being founded by
pioneers of religious freedom</p>
<p>who were seeking liberty from the oppressive English.</p>
<p>We&apos;ve already seen that&apos;s only partly true.</p>
<p>For one thing, Puritan ideas of equality and representation weren&apos;t
particularly equitable or representational.</p>
<p>In truth, America was also founded by indigenous people and by
Spanish settlers,</p>
<p>and the earliest English colonies weren&apos;t about religion; they were
about money.</p>
<p>We&apos;ll see this tension between American mythology and American
history again next week and also every week.</p>

<p>Hi I&apos;m John Green, this is Crash Course US History, and today we&apos;re
going to discuss Thomas Jefferson.</p>
<p>We&apos;re going to learn about how America became a thriving nation of
small, independent farmers,</p>
<p>eschewing manufacturing and world trade,</p>
<p>and becoming the richest and most powerful nation in the world in the
19th century, all thanks to the vision of Thomas Jefferson,</p>
<p>the greatest and most intellectually consistent Founding Father, who
founded the University of Virginia and grew 20 varieties of peas at
Monticello.</p>
<p>Me From the Past, get to your desk!</p>
<p>In a stunning turn of events, Me From the Past is an idiot and
Jefferson is more complicated than that.</p>
<p>[Theme Music]</p>
<p>So in 1800, Thomas Jefferson, pictured here &#x2013; this is the third time
that we&apos;ve featured Thomas Jefferson on the chalkboard, so we had to go
a little Warhol on it.</p>
<p>Right, so, Jefferson, the Republican, ran against John Adams, the
Federalist.</p>
<p>1800 was the first election where both parties ran candidates and
actually campaigned.</p>
<p>And, surprisingly, the Federalist&apos;s elitist strategy of &quot;vote for
Adams because he&apos;s better than you&quot; did not work.</p>
<p>Now, both parties realize that it was important to coordinate their
electoral strategy to make sure that the vice presidential candidate got
at least one fewer electoral votes than the presidential candidate.</p>
<p>But then the Republican elector who was supposed to throw his vote
away forgot to, so there ended up being a tie between Thomas Jefferson
and Aaron Burr.</p>
<p>As per the Constitution, the election went to the House of
Representatives, where it took 36 ballots and the intervention of
Alexander Hamilton before Jefferson was finally named president.</p>
<p>Incidentally, Burr and Hamilton really disliked each other, and not
in like, the passive-aggressive way that politicians dislike each other
these days,</p>
<p>but in the
four-years-later-they-would-have-a-duel-and-Burr-killed-Hamilton kind of
way.</p>
<p>A duel which occurred, wait for it, in New Jersey.</p>
<p>But anyway, shortly after the election of 1800, the 12th Amendment
was passed, making the Electoral College simpler, but not as simple as,
say, you know, one person&apos;s vote counting as one vote.</p>
<p>Anyway, complain about the Electoral College all you want, but
without it, we would never have had President Rutherford B. Hayes, and
just look at that beard!</p>
<p>So Jefferson became president and his election showed that Americans
wanted a more democratic politics, where common people were more free to
express their opinions.</p>
<p>The Federalists were never really a threat again in presidential
politics.</p>
<p>And, arguably, the best thing that John Adams ever did was transfer
power in an orderly and honorable way to his rival, Jefferson.</p>
<p>Jefferson&apos;s campaign slogan was &quot;Jefferson and Liberty,&quot; but the
liberty in question was severely limited.</p>
<p>Only a fraction of white men were allowed to vote and, of course,
there was no liberty for the slaves.</p>
<p>There&apos;s a lot of contentious debate on the subject of Jefferson and
slavery, but here&apos;s my two cents, which I should not be allowed to
contribute because we should only round to the nearest nickel, which, by
the way, features Thomas Jefferson.</p>
<p>So Thomas Jefferson was a racist and he wrote about black people&apos;s
inherent inferiority to whites and Native Americans, and the fact that
he fathered children with one of his slaves doesn&apos;t change that.</p>
<p>George Washington freed his slaves upon his death. Well, sort of.</p>
<p>They were supposed to be freed upon his wife&apos;s death, but living in a
house full of people who were waiting for you to die made Martha want to
free them while she was still alive.</p>
<p>But with few exceptions, Jefferson didn&apos;t free his slaves upon his
death and throughout his life, he used the sale of slaves to finance his
lavish lifestyle.</p>
<p>And this leads to two big philosophical questions when it comes to
history.</p>
<p>First, if Jefferson clearly did not think that black people were the
intellectual or moral equals of whites and was perfectly comfortable
keeping them in bondage,</p>
<p>then what does the most important phrase of the Declaration of
Independence actually mean?</p>
<p>And the second question is even broader:</p>
<p>Does it matter if a person of tremendous historical importance had
terrible aspects to their character?</p>
<p>Does being a bad person diminish your accomplishments?</p>
<p>I don&apos;t have a great answer for those questions, but I will tell you
that no remembers Richard Nixon for starting the EPA.</p>
<p>But this is very important to understand: Slaves were aware of
concept of liberty and they wanted it.</p>
<p>So in addition to an election, 1800 also saw one of the first
large-scale slave uprisings.</p>
<p>Gabriel&apos;s Rebellion was organized by a Richmond, Virginia blacksmith
who hoped to seize the capital, kill some of its inhabitants, and hold
the rest hostage until his demands for abolition were met.</p>
<p>But the plot was discovered before they could carry it out and
Gabriel, along with 25 other slaves, was hanged.</p>
<p>But after the rebellion, Virginians, if they didn&apos;t know it already,
were very aware that slaves wanted and expected liberty.</p>
<p>And the response was predictable: Virginia made its laws concerning
slaves much harsher.</p>
<p>It became illegal for slaves to meet in groups on Sundays unless
supervised by whites, and it became much more difficult for whites to
legally free their slaves.</p>
<p>Oh, it&apos;s time for the Mystery Document?</p>
<p>The rules here are simple:</p>
<p>Identify the author, no shock; fail to identify the author,
shock.</p>
<p>&quot;The love of freedom, sir, is an inborn sentiment, which the god of
nature has planted deep in the heart:</p>
<p>long may it be kept under by the arbitrary institutions of
society;</p>
<p>but, at the first favorable moment, it springs forth, and flourishes
with a vigour that defies all check.</p>
<p>This celestial spark, which fires the breast of the savage, which
glows in that of the philosopher, is not extinguished in the bosom of
the slave.</p>
<p>It may be buried in the embers; but it still lives; and the breath of
knowledge kindles it to flame.</p>
<p>Thus we find, sir, there have never been slaves in any country who
have not seized the first favorable opportunity to revolt.&quot;</p>
<p>I mean, from the bit at the beginning about the love of freedom, it
seems like it could be Jefferson, but the rest does not seem like
Jefferson.</p>
<p>Probably wasn&apos;t a slave, since they were denied access to education
precisely because the &quot;breath of knowledge&quot; is so dangerous to the
institution of slavery.</p>
<p>Oh, this is looking pretty bleak for me, Stan. Mmmmmm. John Jay?</p>
<p>[buzzing noise] Dang it!</p>
<p>Who was it? George Tucker?!</p>
<p>Who the John C. Calhoun is George Tucker?!</p>
<p>Is there a person watching this who knew that it was George
Tucker?</p>
<p>Fine! [electricity noise] Gah!</p>
<p>Apparently George Tucker was a member of the General Assembly of
Virginia and the Mystery Document was a description of Gabriel&apos;s
Rebellion that suggested a solution to the inherent problem of
rebellious slaves.</p>
<p>He argued that we should set up a colony for them in Indian territory
in Georgia, which, of course, also wouldn&apos;t have worked because we were
soon to steal that territory.</p>
<p>But back to Jefferson.</p>
<p>His idea was to make the government smaller, lower taxes, shrink the
military, and make it possible for America to become a bucolic,
agrarian, empire of liberty,</p>
<p>rather than an English-style, industrial, mercantile, nightmare
landscape.</p>
<p>So how did he do? Well, really well at first.</p>
<p>Jefferson got rid of all the taxes, except for the tariff, especially
the Whiskey Tax.</p>
<p>And then, when he woke up with a terrible, cheap whiskey-induced
hangover, he paid off part of the national debt.</p>
<p>He shrunk the army and the navy, and basically made sure that America
wouldn&apos;t become a centralized, English-style state for at least the next
60 years.</p>
<p>Low taxes and small government sounds great, but no navy?</p>
<p>That would be tough, especially when we needed ships and marines to
fight the Barbary pirates &quot;on the shores of Tripoli,&quot; who kept capturing
our ships in the Mediterranean and enslaving their crews.</p>
<p>This is yet another example of how foreign affairs keeps getting in
the way of domestic priorities;</p>
<p>in this case, the domestic priority of not wanting to spend money on
a navy.</p>
<p>Also, vitally, Jefferson&apos;s presidency really marks the last time in
history when a Republican president didn&apos;t want to spend money on the
military.</p>
<p>Don&apos;t get me wrong: Democrats can do it too. I&apos;m looking at you,
LBJ.</p>
<p>As much as he wanted to get rid of any trace of the Federalists,
Jefferson found himself thwarted by that imminently conservative and
undemocratic institution: the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Jefferson appointed Republicans to most government positions, but he
couldn&apos;t do anything about the Supreme Court because they serve for
life.</p>
<p>And since the country was only like, 12 years old, they were all
still pretty fresh.</p>
<p>Most important among them was Chief Justice John Marshall, who
happened to be a Federalist.</p>
<p>Marshall was Chief Justice basically forever and is, without
question, the most important figure in the history of the Supreme
Court.</p>
<p>He wrote a number of key opinions, but none was more important than
the 1803 decision in Marbury v. Madison.</p>
<p>Marbury v. Madison is so important because in that decision, the
Supreme Court gave itself the power of judicial review, which allows it
to uphold or invalidate federal laws.</p>
<p>The Court then extended this power to state laws in Fletcher v. Peck
and eventually even to executive actions.</p>
<p>Like, we think of the main job of the Supreme Court being to declare
laws unconstitutional, but that power isn&apos;t anywhere in the Constitution
itself.</p>
<p>Marbury v. Madison gave the Court that power and without it, the
Supreme Court would probably be a footnote in American history.</p>
<p>So unlike Marshall, Jefferson and the Republicans were big proponents
of strict construction:</p>
<p>the idea that the Constitution should be read as literally as
possible as way of limiting the power of the federal government.</p>
<p>The problem is, there might be things the government wants to do that
the Constitution didn&apos;t account for, like, for instance, buying a large
tract of land from Napoleon, who, as we remember from Crash Course World
History, complicates everything.</p>
<p>Let&apos;s go to the Thought Bubble.</p>
<p>So yeah, Jefferson basically doubled the size of the US in what came
to be known as the Louisiana Purchase.</p>
<p>Napoleon was eager to sell it, because the rebellion in Haiti had
soured him on the whole idea of colonies, and also because he needed
money.</p>
<p>Jefferson wanted to purchase New Orleans because western farmers were
shipping their products through the city and when he approached France
about this, Napoleon was like,</p>
<p>&quot;Hey! How bout I sell you, this!&quot;</p>
<p>Jefferson couldn&apos;t turn down that deal, so he bought the whole kit
and caboodle for $15 million, which is worth about $250 million
today.</p>
<p>To put that into perspective, a new aircraft carrier costs about $4.5
billion, so he got a good deal.</p>
<p>What&apos;s the problem with this?</p>
<p>Well, nothing if you believe in a powerful government that can do
stuff that&apos;s not in the Constitution.</p>
<p>But if you&apos;re a strict Constructionist like Jefferson, you have to
reconcile this obviously beneficial act with there being no mention in
the Constitution of the president being able to purchase land in order
to expand the size of the US.</p>
<p>So laying scruple aside, Jefferson bought Louisiana and then sent
Lewis and Clark to explore it, which they did, even going beyond the
boundaries of the Purchase all the way to the Pacific.</p>
<p>And this was so cool that it almost makes us forget that it was kind
of unconstitutional and a huge power grab for the president.</p>
<p>So the question is: why did he do it?</p>
<p>Jefferson&apos;s desire to increase the size of the country prompted
Federalists to complain that,</p>
<p>&quot;We are to give money, of which we have too little, for land, of
which we already have too much.&quot;</p>
<p>By doubling the size of the country, Jefferson could ensure that
there would be enough land for every white man to have his own small
farm.</p>
<p>And this, in turn, would ensure that Americans would remain
independent and virtuous.</p>
<p>Because only a small farmer who doesn&apos;t have to depend on the market
for food or shelter or anything really (well, except slaves), can be
truly independent, and thus capable of participating in a nation of free
men.</p>
<p>Thanks, Thought Bubble.</p>
<p>And this desire to create a nation of independent farmers producing
only primary products helps explains Jefferson&apos;s other incredibly
controversial policy: the embargo.</p>
<p>Jefferson imposed the embargo in order to punish Britain for its
practice of impressing American sailors, as well as its blockade of
France, with whom Britain was once again, or possibly just still, at
war.</p>
<p>So basically, Jefferson wanted free trade among nations and his
solution was to get Congress to forbid all American ships from sailing
to foreign ports.</p>
<p>The theory was that the British were so dependent on American primary
products, like wood and cotton, that if we cut off trade with them, the
British would stop impressing American sailors and end their
blockade.</p>
<p>What&apos;s the connection between free trade and Jefferson&apos;s agrarian
ideal?</p>
<p>Well, the idea was that America would trade its primary products for
Europe&apos;s manufactured goods, so that the US wouldn&apos;t have to develop any
manufacturing capacity of its own.</p>
<p>Alas, or perhaps fortunately, this did not work.</p>
<p>For one thing, Britain and France were too busy fighting each other
even to notice America&apos;s embargo.</p>
<p>So they just continued blockading and impressing.</p>
<p>Also, the embargo devastated the American economy.</p>
<p>I mean, exports dropped by 80%.</p>
<p>Furthermore, not being able to import European manufactured goods
only served to spur American manufacturing.</p>
<p>I mean, Jefferson might have wanted Americans to be a bunch of
self-sufficient farmers, but Americans wanted European manufactured
stuff, like teapots and clocks and microwaves.</p>
<p>Well, then how did they cook stuff, Stan?</p>
<p>And if they couldn&apos;t get that stuff from Britain, they would just
make it themselves.</p>
<p>So in terms of Jefferson&apos;s agrarian ideal, the embargo was a massive
failure.</p>
<p>And lastly, the embargo limited the power of the federal government
about as much as crystal meth limits cavities.</p>
<p>I mean, imposing the embargo was a colossal use of federal power and
it was also an imposition on people&apos;s liberties.</p>
<p>The problem the embargo was supposed to solve didn&apos;t go away and, as
we&apos;ll discuss next week, it eventually led to the US&apos;s first declared
war.</p>
<p>For now, I want to leave you with this: Thomas Jefferson is revered
and reviled in almost equal measure in American history.</p>
<p>The Declaration of Independence, which he mainly drafted, is a signal
achievement delineating some heroic ideas for the founding of the United
States, but also embedding some of its crucial shortcomings.</p>
<p>And Jefferson&apos;s presidency is like that too.</p>
<p>He claimed to champion small government, but he enlarged federal
power more than Washington or Adams ever did.</p>
<p>He imagined an agrarian republic, but his policies led to increased
manufacturing.</p>
<p>He wanted to foster freedom, but he owned slaves and took land from
the Indians.</p>
<p>In the end, Jefferson&apos;s life and policies encapsulate the best and
the worst of us, which is why his presidency is still worth studying
closely.</p>
<p>I&apos;ll see you next week.</p>

        <p>Purchasing Managers&apos; Index (PMI) Definition and How It Works By THE
INVESTOPEDIA TEAM Investopedia logo Full Bio</p>
<p>Investopedia contributors come from a range of backgrounds, and over
24 years there have been thousands of expert writers and editors who
have contributed.</p>
<p>What Is the Purchasing Managers&apos; Index (PMI)? The Purchasing
Managers&apos; Index (PMI) is an index of the prevailing direction of
economic trends in the manufacturing and service sectors. It consists of
a diffusion index that summarizes whether market conditions are
expanding, staying the same, or contracting as viewed by purchasing
managers. The purpose of the PMI is to provide information about current
and future business conditions to company decision-makers, analysts, and
investors.</p>
<p>KEY TAKEAWAYS The Purchasing Managers Index is a measure of the
prevailing direction of economic trends in manufacturing. The PMI is
based on a monthly survey of supply chain managers across 19 industries,
covering both upstream and downstream activity. The value and movements
in the PMI and its components can provide useful insight to business
decision makers, market analysts, and investors, and is a leading
indicator of overall economic activity in the U.S. Purchasing Managers&apos;
Index (PMI) Formula and Calculation of the Purchasing Managers&apos; Index
(PMI) The PMI is calculated as:</p>
<p>PMI = (P1 * 1) + (P2 * 0.5) + (P3 * 0) Where:</p>
<p>P1 = percentage of answers reporting an improvement<br>
P2 = percentage of answers reporting no change P3 = percentage of
answers reporting a deterioration Other companies also produce PMI
numbers, including IHS Markit Group, which puts out the PMI for various
countries outside the U.S.<br>
How the PMI Works The PMI is a key economic tool and is among the most
reliable leading indicators of the U.S. economy. The index is reported
by manufacturing and services. There is also a hospital PMI that is
released on a monthly basis. The index sheds insight into the business
environment and also helps companies get a grasp on where the economy is
headed.</p>
<p>It is a survey-based indicator that is compiled and released each
month by the Institute for Supply Management (ISM). The survey is sent
to senior executives at more than 400 companies in 19 primary
industries, which are weighted by their contribution to U.S. gross
domestic product (GDP).</p>
<p>The surveys include questions about business conditions and any
changes, whether they are improving or deteriorating, or have no
changes. The PMI is based on five major survey areas&#x2014;each of which is
weighted equally:</p>
<p>New orders Inventory levels Production Supplier deliveries Employment
The headline PMI is a number from 0 to 100. A PMI above 50 represents an
expansion when compared with the previous month. A PMI reading under 50
represents a contraction while a reading at 50 indicates no change. The
further away from 50, the greater the level of change.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-consumer-price-index-cpi">What Is the Consumer Price
Index (CPI)?</h2>
<p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures the monthly change in prices
paid by U.S. consumers. The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bls.asp">Bureau of Labor
Statistics (BLS)</a> calculates the CPI as a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/weightedaverage.asp">weighted
average</a> of prices for a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/basket_of_goods.asp">basket
of goods and services</a> representative of aggregate U.S. consumer
spending.1</p>
<p>The CPI is one of the most popular measures of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/111414/what-difference-between-inflation-and-deflation.asp">inflation
and deflation</a>. The CPI report uses a different survey methodology,
price samples, and index weights than the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/ppi.asp">producer price index
(PPI)</a>, which measures changes in the prices received by U.S.
producers of goods and services.23</p>
<h3 id="key-takeaways">KEY TAKEAWAYS</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Consumer Price Index measures the overall change in consumer
prices based on a representative basket of goods and services over
time.</li>
<li>The CPI is the most widely used measure of inflation, closely
followed by policymakers, financial markets, businesses, and
consumers.</li>
<li>The widely quoted CPI is based on an index covering 93% of the U.S.
population, while a related index covering wage earners and clerical
workers is used for cost-of-living adjustments to federal benefits.</li>
<li>The CPI is based on about 80,000 price quotes collected monthly from
some 23,000 retail and service establishments as well as 50,000 rental
housing units.</li>
<li>Housing rents are used to estimate the change in shelter costs
including owner-occupied housing that account for about a third of the
CPI.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="the-consumer-price-index">The Consumer Price Index</h4>
<h2 id="understanding-the-consumer-price-index-cpi">Understanding the
Consumer Price Index (CPI)</h2>
<p>The BLS collects about 80,000 prices monthly from some 23,000 retail
and service establishments. Although the two CPI indexes calculated from
the data both contain the word urban, the more broad-based and widely
cited of the two covers 93% of the U.S. population.43</p>
<iframe frameborder="0" src="https://3ee46c8e9908f7376a654f70e6df7862.safeframe.googlesyndication.com/safeframe/1-0-40/html/container.html" id="google_ads_iframe_3865/ddm.investopedia.com/ntv1_0" title="3rd party ad content" name scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" width="0" height="346" data-is-safeframe="true" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" role="region" aria-label="Advertisement" tabindex="0" data-google-container-id="g" data-load-complete="true" style="box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px; vertical-align: bottom; min-width: 100%;">
</iframe>
<p>Shelter category prices accounting for a third of the overall CPI are
based on a survey of rental prices for 50,000 housing units, which is
then used to calculate the rise in rental prices as well as owners&apos;
equivalents.35</p>
<p>The owners&apos; equivalent category models the rent equivalent for
owner-occupied housing to properly reflect housing costs&apos; share of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consumer-spending.asp">consumer
spending</a>.5 User fees and sales or excise taxes are included, while
income taxes and the prices of investments such as stocks, bonds, or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lifeinsurance.asp">life
insurance policies</a> are not part of the CPI.3</p>
<p>The calculation of the CPI indexes from the data factors in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/substitution-effect.asp">substitution
effects</a>&#x2014;consumers&apos; tendency to shift spending away from products and
categories has grown relatively more expensive. It also adjusts price
data for changes in product quality and features. The weighting of the
product and service categories in the CPI indexes corresponds to recent
consumer spending patterns derived from a separate survey.67</p>
<p>The CPI-U increased 3.0% over the 12-month period ending June 2023.
That was an increase of 0.2% in June compared with a 0.1% increase in
May 2023.8</p>
<h2 id="types-of-consumer-price-indexes-cpis">Types of Consumer Price
Indexes (CPIs)</h2>
<p>The BLS publishes two indexes each month. The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cpiu.asp">Consumer Price
Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U)</a> represents 93% of the U.S.
population not living in remote rural areas. It doesn&apos;t cover spending
by people living in farm households, institutions, or on military bases.
CPI-U is the basis of the widely reported CPI numbers that matter to
financial markets.</p>
<p>The BLS also publishes the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cpi-w.asp">Consumer Price
Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W)</a>. The CPI-W
covers 29% of the U.S. population living in households with income
derived predominantly from clerical employment or jobs with an hourly
wage.3</p>
<p>CPI-W is used to adjust Social Security payments as well as other
federal benefits and pensions for changes in the cost of living.9 It
also shifts federal income tax brackets to ensure taxpayers aren&apos;t
subjected to a higher marginal rate as a result of inflation.</p>
<h2 id="consumer-price-index-cpi-formulas">Consumer Price Index (CPI)
Formulas</h2>
<p>The more common CPI-U calculation entails two primary formulas. The
first is used to determine the current cost of the weighted-average
basket of products, while the second is used to analyze the
year-over-year change.</p>
<h3 id="annual-cpi-formula">Annual CPI Formula</h3>
<p>To calculate the annual CPI, the BLS divides the value of a specific
basket of goods today compared to one year ago:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Annual CPI=Value of Basket in Current YearValue of Basket in Prior
Year&#xD7;100Annual CPI=Value of Basket in Prior YearValue of Basket in
Current Year&#xD7;100</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the basket of goods and services used in the
CPI calculation is a composite of popular items commonly purchased by
Americans. The weight of each component of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/basket.asp">basket</a> is in
proportion to how they are sold. The annual CPI is reported as a whole
number, and the figure is often greater than 100 (assuming current
market prices are appreciating).</p>
<p>Then, the BLS uses the current year&apos;s CPI and the prior year&apos;s CPI to
calculate the inflation rate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Inflation Rate=New CPI&#x2212;Prior CPIPrior CPI&#xD7;100Inflation Rate=Prior
CPINew CPI&#x2212;Prior CPI&#xD7;100</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The inflation rate can be calculated for a given month or annual
period; in either case, the appropriate new and prior period must be
selected. The inflation rate is reported as a percentage and is often
positive (assuming current market prices are appreciating).</p>
<h2 id="consumer-price-index-cpi-categories">Consumer Price Index (CPI)
Categories</h2>
<p>The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm">monthly
CPI release</a> from the BLS leads with the change from the prior month
for the overall CPI-U as well as its key subcategories, along with the
unadjusted change year-over-year. The BLS detailed tables show price
changes for a variety of goods and services organized by eight umbrella
spending categories.</p>
<p>Subcategories estimate price changes for everything from tomatoes and
salad dressing to auto repairs and sporting events tickets. Price change
for each subcategory is provided with and without <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/seasonal-adjustment.asp">seasonal
adjustment</a>.10 In addition to the national CPI indexes, BLS publishes
CPI data for U.S. regions, sub-regions, and major metropolitan areas.
The metro data is subject to wider fluctuations and is useful mainly for
identifying price changes based on local conditions.11</p>
<p>The table below represents the CPI basket weighted distribution
amongst the eight major expense categories. Be mindful that some
subcategories may be difficult to spot within their major categories.
For example, automobiles are classified under commodities.12</p>

<h2 id="how-is-the-consumer-price-index-cpi-used">How Is the Consumer
Price Index (CPI) Used?</h2>
<p>The CPI is widely used by financial market participants to gauge
inflation and by the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federalreservebank.asp">Federal
Reserve</a> to calibrate its monetary policy. Businesses and consumers
also use the CPI to make informed economic decisions. Since CPI measures
the change in consumers&apos; purchasing power, it is often a key factor in
pay negotiations.</p>
<h3 id="the-federal-reserve">The Federal Reserve</h3>
<p>The Fed uses CPI data to determine economic policy. With a target
inflation rate of 2%, the Fed may enact expansionary monetary policy to
stimulate the economy should market growth slow, or enact contractionary
monetary policy should the economy (and therefore prices) grow too
quickly. In response to higher-than-desired inflation rates via the CPI,
the Fed adjusts the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federalfundsrate.asp">Fed
funds rate</a>.13</p>
<h3 id="other-government-agencies">Other Government Agencies</h3>
<p>The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cola.asp">cost-of-living
adjustments (COLAs)</a> based on the CPI affect federal payments to the
approximately 70 million Americans receiving Social Security and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/ssi.asp">Supplemental
Security Income (SSI)</a> benefits. They also apply to federal pension
payments, school lunch subsidies, and income tax brackets.39</p>
<h3 id="housing">Housing</h3>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage-rates-5094943">Mortgage
rates</a> (and other forms of long-term debt) are often impacted by
rates set by government agencies. As the CPI increases and the
government enacts policy changes to slow inflation, rates often
increase. On the other hand, landlords may use CPI information to
adequately assess what annual rent increases for renters should
be.1415</p>
<h3 id="financial-markets">Financial Markets</h3>
<p>Financial market prices are driven by countless factors. One such
factor is the CPI, as reactionary Fed policies directly impact economic
growth, corporate profits, and consumer spending ability.3</p>
<p>A higher CPI often means that a less stringent government policy is
generally in place. This means that debt is often easier to obtain for
cheaper and that individuals have greater spending capacity. On the
other hand, lower or decreasing CPI may indicate that the government may
ease policy that helps boost the economy.</p>
<h3 id="labor-markets">Labor Markets</h3>
<p>The CPI and its components are also used as a deflator for other
economic indicators, including <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/retail-sales.asp">retail
sales</a> and hourly/weekly earnings, to separate fundamental change
from that reflecting change in prices. Employees may turn to CPI reports
when approaching their employers for a raise based on nationwide
increases in labor rates as well as pricing.16</p>
<p>Be mindful that the CPI is published using national data; employees
may be more suited to using local data to better understand their
specific situation. In addition, some workers covered by collective
bargaining agreements may have their wages tied to changes in CPI.</p>
<h3 id="section"></h3>
<p>The BLS reports the CPI on a fixed, monthly cadence. A schedule of
prior and future releases can be found on the BLS website, and the CPI
is always released at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time.17</p>
<h2 id="consumer-price-index-cpi-vs.-unemployment">Consumer Price Index
(CPI) vs. Unemployment</h2>
<p>In the broadest sense, the CPI and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unemployment.asp">unemployment</a>
rates are often inversely related. This is not always the case in every
economy, but the Federal Reserve often attempts to decrease one metric
while balancing the other. For example, in response to the COVID-19
pandemic, the Federal Reserve took unprecedented supervisory and
regulatory actions to stimulate the economy.18</p>
<p>As a result, the labor market strengthened and returned to
pre-pandemic rates by March 2022; however, this stimulus has resulted in
the highest CPI calculations in decades.19</p>
<p>As a result of higher-than-targeted CPI calculations, the Federal
Reserve began raising interest rates and tapering certain asset
purchases.20 On one hand, these measures aim to slow economic growth,
make it more expensive for consumers to acquire debt, and stem monetary
supply growth.</p>
<p>On the other hand, these additional expenses may burden households
and make companies less profitable. All else being equal when the
Federal Reserve attempts to lower the CPI, it runs the risk of
unintentionally increasing unemployment rates.</p>
<h2 id="critiques-of-consumer-price-index-cpi-methodology">Critiques of
Consumer Price Index (CPI) Methodology</h2>
<p>Because the CPI Index is so crucial to economic policy and
decision-making, its methodology has long been controversial, drawing
claims it either understates or overstates <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inflation.asp">inflation</a>.
A panel of economists commissioned by Congress to study the issue in
1995 concluded the CPI overstated inflation and was followed by
calculation changes to better reflect substitution effects.21</p>
<p>More recently, critics have claimed that adjustments for changes in
product quality and features understate the CPI. According to the BLS,
the particularly controversial hedonic adjustments, which use regression
techniques to adjust prices for new features on a relatively small
proportion of the CPI items, have a net effect close to zero on the
index.22</p>
<p>As the traditional CPI-U calculation only measures inflation for
urban populations, it remains a less-than-reliable source of data for
individuals living in rural areas. In addition, the CPI does not
explicitly state how different demographics may be impacted by
inflation. For example, soaring education costs may adversely impact
younger individuals, while the impact of increasing elderly care costs
is felt by a different group of individuals.</p>
<p>This notion is also widely attributable to individuals with varying
degrees of income. For example, lower-income individuals who contribute
more gross income towards necessities of shelter and food will skew
differently than households with larger disposable income. For this
reason, the CPI may not adequately reflect each individual&apos;s experience
in regard to costs and changes over time.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-current-cpi">What Is the Current CPI?</h2>
<p>The annual change in the CPI was 3.0% for the 12-month period ending
June 2023. This was a 0.2% increase from the previous month.8</p>
<h2 id="how-is-the-consumer-price-index-used">How Is the Consumer Price
Index Used?</h2>
<p>The CPI Index is an inflation indicator closely watched by
policymakers and financial markets. A related CPI measure is used to
calculate cost-of-living adjustments for federal benefit payments.</p>
<h2 id="how-is-the-cpi-calculated">How Is the CPI Calculated?</h2>
<p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics samples 80,000 prices monthly to
calculate the CPI, weighing the index for each product or service in
proportion to its share of recent consumer spending to calculate the
overall change in prices. The calculation also factors in the
substitution effect as consumers shift spending away from the products
rising in price on a relative basis. The CPI also adjusts for changes in
product quality and features. The numbers are provided with and without
seasonal adjustments.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-some-criticisms-of-the-cpi">What Are Some Criticisms of
the CPI?</h2>
<p>Over the years, the CPI has frequently drawn criticism that it has
either understated or overstated inflation. Because the CPI is based on
consumer spending, it doesn&apos;t track third-party reimbursements for
healthcare and significantly underweights healthcare relative to its
proportion in the GDP as a result. On the other hand, criticism
concerning the quality adjustments used in the CPI has been widely
discounted by economists.</p>

<p>The Consumer Price Index is an important economic metric. It measures
the average change in prices paid by consumers over a period of time for
a basket of goods and services. The index is calculated and published
monthly by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It is among the most common
measures of inflation, indicating the health and direction of the
economy. It also serves in other capacities, notably to help make
adjustments to certain income payments, such as Social Security and
pensions for federal civil service retirees.</p>

Kundera was a writer of caustic irony and mordant wit</h1>
<h2 id="he-believed-the-novelist-is-neither-historian-nor-prophet-but-an-explorer-of-existence">He
believed the novelist is &#x201C;neither historian nor prophet&#x201D; but &#x201C;an
explorer of existence&#x201D;</h2>
<p>In milan kundera&#x2019;s most famous novel, &#x201C;The Unbearable Lightness of
Being&#x201D;, a dissident Czech artist feted in Germany finds herself lauded
as a &#x201C;saint or martyr&#x201D;. Sabina protests, however, that her &#x201C;enemy is
kitsch, not Communism!&#x201D; Mr Kundera, who died on July 11th aged 94, moved
from a fervent youthful socialism to global renown as an exiled author
who dissected and derided the follies and cruelties of the Soviet
satellite regime that ruled his homeland until 1989. He insisted always,
though, on the supremacy of art over any ideology, and championed the
novelist&#x2019;s vocation in an era &#x201C;befogged with ideas and indifferent to
works&#x201D;.</p>
<p>For Mr Kundera, the deadly foe of truthful art was kitsch: the
narcissistic sentimentality that, under any social system, effaces
realities and encourages people to &#x201C;gaze into the mirror of the
beautifying lie&#x201D;. With caustic irony, mordant wit and acrobatic literary
skill, he mocked the beautifying lie wherever he found it&#x2014;in politics,
in culture or in personal relationships. Before and after the collapse
of the Soviet bloc, Mr Kundera became one of the world&#x2019;s best-known
critics of the abstract idealism that can lead to tyranny. In agile,
fragmentary, essay-like fictions, he took aim at the belief in history
as a progressive &#x201C;Grand March&#x201D; towards &#x201C;brotherhood, equality, justice,
happiness&#x201D;.</p>
<p>Yet his scorn for &#x201C;totalitarian&#x201D; idealists had its roots in his
experience as one of them. Born in Brno in 1929 as a musician&#x2019;s son, he
studied literature in Prague; as communists took power in 1948, he
produced poetry to glorify their revolution. &#x201C;I too once danced in a
ring,&#x201D; he writes in &#x201C;The Book of Laughter and Forgetting&#x201D;. He too felt
&#x201C;the magic qualities of the circle&#x201D;.</p>
<p>Soon, the circle broke. A gag that went wrong, commemorated in &#x201C;The
Joke&#x201D;, led to his expulsion from the party in 1950. Although he returned
to party loyalty for a while, and taught literature to film students in
Prague, &#x201C;The Joke&#x201D;&#x2014;published in 1967, then banned&#x2014;set him on the road to
official disgrace, dissidence and exile. Having understood &#x201C;what it is
for a man to live through the death of his nation&#x201D; after the Soviet
invasion in 1968, he lived in France from 1975. Later, he would write in
French.</p>
<p>Playful, elusive, experimental, Mr Kundera eschewed not just the
&#x201C;Grand March&#x201D; but the grand statement. &#x201C;My lifetime ambition,&#x201D; he told
the <em>Paris Review</em>, &#x201C;has been to unite the utmost seriousness of
question with the utmost lightness of form.&#x201D; Music, his first love, gave
him a model. His novels consist of sets of variations (often in seven
parts) composed in the vein he admired in the greatest central European
writers: &#x201C;the privileged sphere of analysis, lucidity, irony&#x201D;.</p>
<p>After his breakthroughs with &#x201C;The Book of Laughter and Forgetting&#x201D;
(1979) and &#x201C;The Unbearable Lightness of Being&#x201D; (1984), readers and
writers around the world&#x2014;from Philip Roth to Salman Rushdie&#x2014;found in Mr
Kundera a liberating inspiration. Sceptics deemed him chilly,
manipulative, aloof. His cold-eyed, even abrasive, appraisal of both
women&#x2019;s and men&#x2019;s romantic lives brought charges of misogyny. He
revelled in not only &#x201C;the undiscovered comic side to history&#x201D; but also
&#x201C;the (hard-to-take) comic side of sexuality&#x201D;.</p>
<p>Although later novels&#x2014;he wrote ten&#x2014;shrank in size and impact, he kept
faith with the art of fiction. For Mr Kundera, the novelist is &#x201C;neither
historian nor prophet&#x201D; but &#x201C;an explorer of existence&#x201D;. Fiction preserves
reality in an age of oblivion, since &#x201C;the struggle of man against power
is the struggle of memory against forgetting.&#x201D; And humour gives fiction
its resilience: not just funny turns, but an &#x201C;unobtrusive light&#x201D; that
&#x201C;glows over the vast landscape of life&#x201D;. Its mortal foe, both in
communist and consumerist society, will always be the dishonesty and
phoney solidarity of kitsch. Against humourless sentimentalists and
ideologists, novelists opened a realm of freedom and tolerance, Mr
Kundera thought: a place &#x201C;where no one owns the truth and everyone has
the right to be understood.&#x201D;</p>

<p>I have arranged the work the literature in the category of language,
at. the first instinct I am going to feel that this is just so logical
and inherent coherent because literature is absolutely a form a language
right? But if you dare to think a little bit deeper you would understand
that this is just not the case. But I will temporarily let it just be
here. Maybe I am lazy and my head is now a slightly dizzing and I
possess a feeling of uneasy and nausea but the level that gonna push in
the largest extent.</p>
<p>Page 64( the one publsihed by penguin in 2015)some of the part of my
fond or favorito(jajaja this is a spanish word)</p>
<p>Next day they drove downtown to buy thing needed for the camp: any
wearable purchase worked wonders with Lo. She seemed her usual sarcastic
self at dinner. Immediately afterwards, she went up to her room to
plunge into the comic books acquired for rainy days at Camp Q(they were
so thoroughly sampled ny Thursday that she left then behind ). I too
tired to my lair(-), and wrote letters. My plan now was to leave for the
seaside and then, whem school began, resume my existence in the Haze
child. On Tuesday they went shopping again, and I was asked to answer
the phone of the cap mistress rang up during there absence. She did, and
a month or so laterwe had occasion to recall oue pleasant chat. That
Tuesday, Lo had her dinner in her room. She had been crying after a
routine row with her mother and, as had happened on former occasions,
had not wished me to see her swollen eyes: she had one of those tender
complexions that after a good cry get all blurred and inflamed, and
morbid alluring. I regretted keenly her mistake about my private
aesthetics, for I simply love that tinge of Bottceillian pink, that raw
rose about the lips, those wet, matted eyelashes; and, naturally, her
bashful whim deprived me of many opportunities of specious consolation.
There was, however, more to it than I thought .As we sat in the darkness
of the veranda( a rude wind that had put out her red candles), Haze,
with a dreary laugh, said she had told Lo that her beloved humbert
thoroughly approved of the whole camp idea &quot;and now&quot;, added Hazed, &quot; the
child throws a fit:&quot;pretext: you and I want to get rid of her: actual
reason: I told her we could exchange tomorrow for a plainer stuff some
much too cute night things that she bullied me into buying for her. You
see, she sees herself as a starlet: I see her as sturdy, healthy, but
decidedly homely kids. Thus I guess, is at the root of our troubles.</p>
<p>On Wednesday I managed to waylay Lo for a few seconds: she was on the
landing, in sweatshirt and green-stained white shorts, rummaging, in a
trunk. I said somehthing meant to be friendly and funny but she only
emitted a snort without looking at me. Desperate, dying Humbert patted
her clumsily on her coccyx</p>
<p>wihout be raped heresy the most orgastic part made to burst into
