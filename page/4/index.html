        <p>so our next speaker is John klauser he was born in Pasadena
California Us in 1942. he studied undergraduate physics at Caltech and
Colombia University New York and received a PhD in physics from Columbia
University in 1969 from 1969 to 1997 he worked at University of
California Berkeley Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and Lawrence
leave them all National Laboratory he&apos;s pressed presently research
physicist at his own private lab in Walnut Creek California so please
join me in welcoming John closer to the stage to tell us about the
development that led to this year&apos;s price oops no wait a minute poof I&apos;m
not I&apos;m not connected no that&apos;s we&apos;re not something is not right uh let
me start over again then here okay okay uh what I did in all of this was
the first experiments to actually uh test what uh John Bell had shown us
was probably one of the most important uh discoveries I I would think of
uh the recent decade or the recent Century if in fact the so these are
so I will discuss the experiments and then a in order to understand the
experiments Mike horn and I developed what&apos;s now called the theory of
local realism which is in essence Einstein&apos;s whole program for uh doing
physics and unfortunately it&apos;s wrong which is what the experiments show
and finally I will end with the uh does this work yeah uh discussion of
why I still am totally confused about what&apos;s going on with quantum
mechanics okay let me start with question is what is quantum mechanic
what is quantum entanglement okay uh quantum entanglement uh started out
with Schrodinger Schrodinger produced not one but two important
equations you started out with the first uh equation which was for
single particles the particular hydrogen which has a single electron and
he miraculously it described the structure the structure and the energy
levels of hydrogen but more complicated was helium which had two
electrons so he produces a a a second uh equation which now involves two
electrons the two are very different equations the second one allows
quantum entanglement which is a new equate uh Solutions emerged from
from the second equation and the peculiarity is that the two electrons
are now intimately uh correlated at the time nobody suggested doing any
experiments to test this rather bizarre prediction however both Einstein
and Schrodinger were very disturbed by this phenomenon and in fact uh
Einstein badalski Rosen in 35 proposed the addition of additional
variables through quantum mechanics to in order to explain what&apos;s going
on Niels Bohr on the other hand said no they&apos;re not needed and and I
discussed all of this very nicely so one of the question first questions
I was asked when I was talking about this in the uh Swedish Embassy uh a
couple of weeks ago was what is a bell inequality this is what we in
fact uh tested there&apos;s not one but there&apos;s actually three important bill
inequalities that I want to talk about the first of course was John
Bell&apos;s 1964 inequality but uh uh and I&apos;ll described very nicely there&apos;s
one problem with being of the theory in order to be useful a theory must
make an experimental prediction and unfortunately uh John Bell&apos;s uh uh
paper made no experimental predictions because it made demanded a
perfect experiment and uh which which had certain uh certainty in the
outcomes and as uh Ben Franklin pointed about the only thing certain in
life are or in nature are death and taxes unfortunately this is not
Texas so the uh uh with uh help from uh my associates uh Mike Horn uh
admir shimone and Dick Holt who is here in the in the audience uh uh
We&apos;ve uh produced the uh closer horns for money Holt now commonly
referred to as chsh inequality which was made the uh first real testable
experimental prediction so and we proposed a detailed experiment to do
that and we noticed various important loopholes uh one of which of
course was mentioned that he tested but a very important loophole was
that the data really couldn&apos;t violate the inequality on their own so we
had to add some additional assumptions so the third inequality is now uh
the was uh produced by Mike horn and I uh in 1974 and it is the first
loophole free experimentally testable uh uh inequality okay let&apos;s start
with the first one uh Atlanta&apos;s already noticed this I signed panelski
Rosen had always and and others had always assumed that that quantum
mechanics always made uh correct predictions the grand irony of this
Bell&apos;s paper is that he showed that Einstein&apos;s original intent of that
paper was exactly the opposite of what was true that the if they wanted
to show that that the correct predictions led to uh the need for hidden
variables and what bell showed was that if you put it hidden variables
in then you can&apos;t get the uh predictions of quantum mechanics so again I
said it was not really testable so uh chsh in 1969 we were inspired by
this work and said wondered well this can we really relieve the get rid
of Einstein&apos;s requirement for a perfect experiment and indeed we found
yes we could and so we designed an experiment uh to actually test it we
worked out all the details of what you uh you needed to do in order to
test it uh and that was the first actual hard experimental prediction uh
and it doesn&apos;t you require uh bills uh impossible to achieve its
conditions so uh we now have two theories two different sets of
predictions quantum mechanics and bills uh the CH inequalities
prediction so being an experimentalist let&apos;s actually do an experiment
and find out which one is true so in order to do this we had to add a
minor supplementary conditions but they were we believe that they&apos;re of
quite reasonable rather weak Okay the third inequality is the CH or the
closer horn inequality that was developed in 1974 uh and it was to test
uh what is now called local realism we wanted to we wondered when we
were doing the experiments we wondered what is really being tested here
is it just the addition of hidden variables or is it something more
profound than that and we found that indeed it is far more profound it
was a test of Einstein&apos;s whole platform for doing physics that we
effectively were putting him out of business and so when we and in fact
the theory when we develop it was effectively Dead on Arrival it was
already refuted but nonetheless we tried to put it in as clear as
possible set of terms as we could so and in the process we formatted a
new inequality the CH inequality and it allows loophole free tests so uh
now if with some even milder additional assumptions then the first
experiments that uh that I had done uh 72 and 76 uh actually knocked it
out so that it was already dead more recently and it&apos;s taken a long time
because the technology did not exist at all to in order to test it in
1974. uh it has now been tested conclusively with so now without any
loopholes at all one can say uh and I agree with the last early uh
conclusion it&apos;s dead Jim so what are some of the experiments uh there
are three important ones that that I did uh first was with Stu Friedman
who was a graduate student at UC Berkeley in 19 uh we published a
results in 1972 and this was the the first experiment to actually test
the chsh inequality in the in parallel with us as Nicole I mentioned who
is here was working with Frank Pipkin at Harvard and they got the
opposite result oops one of us is is in trouble so they decided not to
publish they were skeptical of their results but now I&apos;m skeptical of my
results so uh what do I do well I just decided Well I needed to uh
repeat uh their version of the experiment which I did in 1976. and then
there&apos;s just along the way one of our assumptions had uh and I was kind
of searching for loopholes uh had required photons to act like particles
but I discovered that there was no actual experimentals uh proof that
that particles that photons did act like particles so I did an
experiment 74 to prove that okay so here is the the first experiment a
picture of it and that all at the uh right in it was a very young Stu
Friedman uh in the middle is a the atomic beam apparatus sitting there
pumping away oil leaking all over the floor pair of polarizers on each
side which would which would rotate so and this one became a stu
Friedman&apos;s PhD thesis at uh uh Cal Berkeley so what we did is we had a
calcium Atomic beam and we excited it with this UV lab very weak
extension we wished we&apos;d had lasers which didn&apos;t exist at the time so uh
we got 6.3 Sigma result I mean the five Sigma uh Criterion that is now
common was invented by Louis Alvarez at Berkeley and he he uh was a a
strong Taskmaster on any experimental results that came out of Berkeley
so this was the the second experiment which I did I mentioned uh this
was a repeat of the whole uh Pipkin experiment I use the same polarizers
but I used their uh uh Source uh of mercury uh foreign the two photons
and Dick Hort uh hold uh very generously taught me how to do it uh could
not uh there&apos;s a it&apos;s not an easy and that is my Nobel artifact that I
have donated is one of the the sources so it used Mercury uh with an
electron beam exciting yeah the atoms and I got at least a four Sigma
result there and we use this the same protocol in order to uh introduce
the the assumptions so the other experiment that I mentioned had to deal
with it did particles was there a real way experimentally demonstrated
wave particle duality for photons photons started in 1917 when Einstein
was trying to explain how do does a gas and a thermal uh applied
spectrum of Life come to equilibrium thermal equilibrium with each other
and he noticed that photons had to be behave by what he called
directional energy bundles uh we now call them photons then Schrodinger
noticed that what&apos;s the difference between asking the question well
what&apos;s the difference between a particle and a wave well a a wave could
be just as a classical pulse of light and that is commonly referred to
as the old Schrodinger uh interpretation so how does one tell tell them
apart suppose you have a source and you send light through a half silver
mirror if it&apos;s a wave the wave will go both ways reduced intensity if
it&apos;s a particle the particle will go one way or the other now if I have
two detectors behind the uh the half silvered mirror if it&apos;s a wave they
will both see this pulse and there will be finite a probability that
both will register simultaneously if it&apos;s a particle only one of them so
how does one uh do that uh so actually Schrodinger suggested this and
yannisi and uh Budapest actually tried it but unfortunately they put in
did an inconclusive experiment so I went back and started figured out
how did one do it totally conclusively and uh so I did it actually where
you&apos;re using the the same source that are used for the uh producing the
for the Mercury uh bellotherm experiment uh who had photons going in
both ways and two half silver mirrors and using some a work front by uh
Glover&apos;s formulation what could show that&apos;s the The Coincidence rate
between here and here there should be none of course if if it&apos;s a
particle but but there should be an anomalous if it&apos;s a wave uh a
coincidence rate the product of these two coincidence rates here and
here uh must be greater than the the uh Pro uh the product of these
coincidence rates and so here&apos;s the data and it&apos;s quite the opposite by
about uh 20 Sigma so indeed particles to do act uh photons do act like
particles so as I mentioned before Mike horn and I were trying to
understand what it is that Bell&apos;s theorem experiments actually say so we
developed What&apos;s called the theory of local realism originally we called
it objective local theories uh in our first paper on it and it&apos;s an
extremely general theory that takes it to account all of the basic uh
elements of Einstein&apos;s platform and uh in along the way we produced the
CH inequality which is actually a hard experimental prediction with no
loopholes we did not have any Assumption of causality which we had
earlier in there was no Behavior requirement for a particle like
Behavior uh and then there was some discussion among various other
workers John Bell and admir shimoni added additional components so
presumably uh it is better called Bill clauser Horn shimoni local
realism it&apos;s very short-lived as I mentioned it was already Dead on
Arrival but that wasn&apos;t good enough it had to really be shown to be dead
with no loopholes to it by testing okay what does it assume localism is
extremely Simple Theory Anton zeilinger and please quote me uh tell me
if if I am misquoting you at one point he had a conference he said if
Belle&apos;s inequality and local over realism had been discovered before
quantum mechanics it is so reasonable it would have been taken as a law
of nature or adapted as a law of nature uh unfortunately it&apos;s wrong so
what does local realism assume it assumes that nature is made out of
stuff um well what is stuff well we we may not even know what it is it
is uh it is what I signed Podolski Rosen referred to as elements of
reality it&apos;s what we call matter or uh uh What uh closer horn called
objects John Bell referred to it as beebles it&apos;s there it&apos;s distributed
throughout space now actually Einstein&apos;s whole program in general as if
any in particular goes a lot further and he said they said says that
well it has a finite mass energy density and it it is that density that
determines the whole geometry of the universe we don&apos;t need that for
local realism all we need is that it&apos;s there so it could it could evolve
stochastically or it could evolve uh deterministically we don&apos;t care
it&apos;s stuff is stuff you can put in a box you could uh throughout it and
it&apos;s the stuff that&apos;s in the Box if you&apos;re doing an experiment the stuff
determines the probabilities of the experiment that you actually do
there we assume that there are Real Results the that happen when you do
an experiment that is uh unlike uh Schrodinger actually he he thought
the whole idea of the The Cat In The Box experiment was a total of
absurdity we assume that the cat is either alive or dead and we just
don&apos;t know which that a real result always occurs presumed that the
properties of the stuff determine the results of an experiment you do
the if you have a parameter setting on your apparatus and then you
change the parameter setting presumably you will get a different result
so what does it predict well suppose you have two very widely separated
boxes each has stuff in it and you&apos;re doing experiments in these two uh
wide separated boxes so you&apos;ve hurt the Assumption the following
Einstein&apos;s uh requirement for locality is that stuff in one box and the
out of the parameter settings uh the result of the experiment in one box
measuring that stuff cannot be influenced by the parameter setting
Choice made in the distant box that&apos;s all you need to produce uh uh the
uh the closer horn inequality okay so here&apos;s what are boxes well they&apos;re
just closed surfaces they separate each closed surface separates has a
an inside and an outside so here we have a pair of boxes okay these
characters are uh well I made that drawing in 1976 uh before the
characters had been named uh Alice and Bob well okay so this but she but
she perhaps trans I don&apos;t know so what uh here we have Alice and Bob
making measurements and they get a result yes no on each side so we have
our boxes here are now shrinking at the speed of light and so there&apos;s
drawn so that we&apos;re doing the experiments when there&apos;s space like
separated so if I plotted versus X and time uh here are the boxes
shrinking uh simultaneously and doing experiments so the assumption is
that stuff back here in the common overlap region is what is the result
of of the extremist if you read some of John Bell&apos;s stuff you have to be
careful for some reason he had these reverse he had the arrow of time
going to the left uh I&apos;m sure he had a reason for it but I don&apos;t know
what it was okay it&apos;s dead Jim I apologize to Star Trek who was for a
long time it was very difficult to do this the technology just simply
did not exist back in 74. but it has improved so it became very
important to eliminate the loopholes in the earlier CH tests of the chsh
inequality and uh to really do a loophole free experiment and finally
most recently at a labs in Vienna and in Champaign Urbana uh Illinois uh
it has been totally killed dead okay now I will use what my time
remaining to make a a value statement if you will about why I have the
fattest idea what&apos;s going on and I argue that in fact there&apos;s been an
elephant in the room pardon the metaphor that has been hanging around
ever since uh Schrodinger and epr remember the trottinger produced two
very different equations he had one for hydrogen with only a single
particle and he had another one for helium which had two particles
nobody seemed concerned at the time about the fact that these two
equations were formulated in very different spaces and they I are what I
believe is improperly linked and I&apos;ll go on to that in a minute by what
I call borns ambiguity born was the one who who said that they are
equivalent and this this has been the elephant&apos;s been hiding in plain
sight and I noticed that in fact the Einstein podolsky Rosen art debate
a bore debate was never really settled various textbook authors believed
one or the other of the authors and they&apos;re developed in the literature
in the textbook industry two very different schools of thought and most
people never seem to notice this but with the Advent of local realism
and quantum entanglement then it became clear that one could actually
contrast and identify these two schools of thought okay School number
one either is essentially a form of local realism so one of the
textbooks that promote uh uh uh the School number one it is what I call
the laboratory space formulation of quantum mechanics okay it was taught
you&apos;re all I kind of cut off the uh the list at about 1980 begin at
first was born born&apos;s textbook two very important uh textbooks uh
familiar Dickie and whitkey and mersbacher were very popular uh all
follow this uh like for example inborn case the waves are propagating in
the lab and he shows pictures of waves moving around all of these books
show waves in the it was propagating through a two-slit experiment in
lab space Feynman uh this is his review article 1948 even puts it into
the title this is a space-time uh operation French French and Taylor uh
using MIT and of course the Original Classic shift okay what is School
number one Quantum Mechanics for single particle systems is formulated
in lab space or real space the XYZ of this room and Heather is a point
every point in this lab space has a vector to it and Schrodinger&apos;s wave
function is a function of its position uh in the room or in the lab and
more importantly the probability density PSI star PSI is a function of
his position in the room it is the evolution of of these waves is
governed by Schrodinger&apos;s equation in lab space and it depicts waves of
probability you&apos;ve probably heard any number of people describe quantum
mechanics says waves the probability moreover there&apos;s also it&apos;s defined
by born a conserved uh probability current which flows like a fluid
through through the lab and he famously used that uh of current to
describe flux conservation frieden Rutherford scattering unfortunately
it only works the slab school of thought number one only works for
single particle systems it cannot describe two particle systems or and
it cannot describe entanglement so what&apos;s goal number two also had a
large group of textbooks which very specifically said we are in
configuration space okay probably one of the most important ones but
beta and saw Peter with the authoritative work on hydrogen and helium
Jordan and Drell relative is a quantum mechanics caught in and shortly
uh calculate Spectra of atoms land down on lift shits great quantum
mechanics to expect it was translated by John Bell actually and
messiah&apos;s famous book uh except he he claims he&apos;s in in configuration
space but actually he cheats a bit and probably most importantly fall
was Von Neumann&apos;s textbook okay what is the configuration space School
of quantum mechanics it is a very very different from what I just
described the wave function depends on A System&apos;s degrees of freedom
this Kim&apos;s there could be many of them uh there could be k degrees of
some large number k and so we have a wave function and these are all
this is straight out of Von Neumann&apos;s uh both so if you have say two
particles in helium then now the argument space of the wave function is
very different it has an x y z of particle one XYZ of particle two wait
our lab does not have six dimensions something has dramatically changed
importantly the position in the lab is not one of the arguments that
means that its value is the same everywhere is base unlike the lab space
formulation that there were it&apos;s different every point in space so
Schrodinger&apos;s equation now is very different it&apos;s divided describing the
evolution of particles in this configuration space it&apos;s an abstract
mathematical space it is not at all this the space uh that Star Trek was
exploring the a few important and it&apos;s absolutely required if you want
to discuss more than one particle systems borns conserved currents
cannot be drawn in a configuration space Green&apos;s theorem does not apply
more importantly the there is no prohibition for propagation of signals
faster than life in configuration space it&apos;s a purely arbitrary space
totally as fact it&apos;s what the imaginations call a vector space not at
all so it was been asserted and I as far as I could trace back this was
originally to to Bourne&apos;s uh dog that uh these two cases are are the
same they are not clearly the two uh wave functions are very different
they are not equivalent one depends on the position of space one does
not there are no Associated probability waves for configuration space so
for my last slide I will describe why I find this all totally confusing
you gotta have configuration space in order to describe more than one
particle systems but there&apos;s no reason uh that the special case of
signal particle systems should be any different so you need a so and we
notice really that the lab space formulation is uh really a form of
local realism it&apos;s dead Jim so now all of these great models conceptual
models of probability waves propagating in space are also dead the flow
of currents probability currents are dead I don&apos;t know how to visualize
propagation in configuration space there are a lot of people here who
know a lot more quantum mechanics than I do and maybe one of them will
help me understand what does it mean to have a way of propagating and
configuration space I don&apos;t know uh thinking Wiki and Bruce bucker were
on my side they both said gave up and said oh gee this is all our our
great models i.ei earlier uh sections of the book we really should throw
throw away so I have one final challenge to my theorist friends if I
still have any remember we said that that general relativity uh is a
form of local realism so and it is a general relativity that for example
gives us black holes so but that&apos;s all formulated in under a local
realism Theory so my challenge is to the theorists is it possible to
have two entangled black hole spins thank you</p>

        <h1 id="milan-kundera-was-a-writer-of-caustic-irony-and-mordant-wit">Milan
Kundera was a writer of caustic irony and mordant wit</h1>
<h2 id="he-believed-the-novelist-is-neither-historian-nor-prophet-but-an-explorer-of-existence">He
believed the novelist is &#x201C;neither historian nor prophet&#x201D; but &#x201C;an
explorer of existence&#x201D;</h2>
<p>In milan kundera&#x2019;s most famous novel, &#x201C;The Unbearable Lightness of
Being&#x201D;, a dissident Czech artist feted in Germany finds herself lauded
as a &#x201C;saint or martyr&#x201D;. Sabina protests, however, that her &#x201C;enemy is
kitsch, not Communism!&#x201D; Mr Kundera, who died on July 11th aged 94, moved
from a fervent youthful socialism to global renown as an exiled author
who dissected and derided the follies and cruelties of the Soviet
satellite regime that ruled his homeland until 1989. He insisted always,
though, on the supremacy of art over any ideology, and championed the
novelist&#x2019;s vocation in an era &#x201C;befogged with ideas and indifferent to
works&#x201D;.</p>
<p>For Mr Kundera, the deadly foe of truthful art was kitsch: the
narcissistic sentimentality that, under any social system, effaces
realities and encourages people to &#x201C;gaze into the mirror of the
beautifying lie&#x201D;. With caustic irony, mordant wit and acrobatic literary
skill, he mocked the beautifying lie wherever he found it&#x2014;in politics,
in culture or in personal relationships. Before and after the collapse
of the Soviet bloc, Mr Kundera became one of the world&#x2019;s best-known
critics of the abstract idealism that can lead to tyranny. In agile,
fragmentary, essay-like fictions, he took aim at the belief in history
as a progressive &#x201C;Grand March&#x201D; towards &#x201C;brotherhood, equality, justice,
happiness&#x201D;.</p>
<p>Yet his scorn for &#x201C;totalitarian&#x201D; idealists had its roots in his
experience as one of them. Born in Brno in 1929 as a musician&#x2019;s son, he
studied literature in Prague; as communists took power in 1948, he
produced poetry to glorify their revolution. &#x201C;I too once danced in a
ring,&#x201D; he writes in &#x201C;The Book of Laughter and Forgetting&#x201D;. He too felt
&#x201C;the magic qualities of the circle&#x201D;.</p>
<p>Soon, the circle broke. A gag that went wrong, commemorated in &#x201C;The
Joke&#x201D;, led to his expulsion from the party in 1950. Although he returned
to party loyalty for a while, and taught literature to film students in
Prague, &#x201C;The Joke&#x201D;&#x2014;published in 1967, then banned&#x2014;set him on the road to
official disgrace, dissidence and exile. Having understood &#x201C;what it is
for a man to live through the death of his nation&#x201D; after the Soviet
invasion in 1968, he lived in France from 1975. Later, he would write in
French.</p>
<p>Playful, elusive, experimental, Mr Kundera eschewed not just the
&#x201C;Grand March&#x201D; but the grand statement. &#x201C;My lifetime ambition,&#x201D; he told
the <em>Paris Review</em>, &#x201C;has been to unite the utmost seriousness of
question with the utmost lightness of form.&#x201D; Music, his first love, gave
him a model. His novels consist of sets of variations (often in seven
parts) composed in the vein he admired in the greatest central European
writers: &#x201C;the privileged sphere of analysis, lucidity, irony&#x201D;.</p>
<p>After his breakthroughs with &#x201C;The Book of Laughter and Forgetting&#x201D;
(1979) and &#x201C;The Unbearable Lightness of Being&#x201D; (1984), readers and
writers around the world&#x2014;from Philip Roth to Salman Rushdie&#x2014;found in Mr
Kundera a liberating inspiration. Sceptics deemed him chilly,
manipulative, aloof. His cold-eyed, even abrasive, appraisal of both
women&#x2019;s and men&#x2019;s romantic lives brought charges of misogyny. He
revelled in not only &#x201C;the undiscovered comic side to history&#x201D; but also
&#x201C;the (hard-to-take) comic side of sexuality&#x201D;.</p>
<p>Although later novels&#x2014;he wrote ten&#x2014;shrank in size and impact, he kept
faith with the art of fiction. For Mr Kundera, the novelist is &#x201C;neither
historian nor prophet&#x201D; but &#x201C;an explorer of existence&#x201D;. Fiction preserves
reality in an age of oblivion, since &#x201C;the struggle of man against power
is the struggle of memory against forgetting.&#x201D; And humour gives fiction
its resilience: not just funny turns, but an &#x201C;unobtrusive light&#x201D; that
&#x201C;glows over the vast landscape of life&#x201D;. Its mortal foe, both in
communist and consumerist society, will always be the dishonesty and
phoney solidarity of kitsch. Against humourless sentimentalists and
ideologists, novelists opened a realm of freedom and tolerance, Mr
Kundera thought: a place &#x201C;where no one owns the truth and everyone has
the right to be understood.&#x201D;</p>

<p>I have arranged the work the literature in the category of language,
at. the first instinct I am going to feel that this is just so logical
and inherent coherent because literature is absolutely a form a language
right? But if you dare to think a little bit deeper you would understand
that this is just not the case. But I will temporarily let it just be
here. Maybe I am lazy and my head is now a slightly dizzing and I
possess a feeling of uneasy and nausea but the level that gonna push in

<p>Next day they drove downtown to buy thing needed for the camp: any
wearable purchase worked wonders with Lo. She seemed her usual sarcastic
self at dinner. Immediately afterwards, she went up to her room to
plunge into the comic books acquired for rainy days at Camp Q(they were
so thoroughly sampled ny Thursday that she left then behind ). I too
tired to my lair(-), and wrote letters. My plan now was to leave for the
seaside and then, whem school began, resume my existence in the Haze
child. On Tuesday they went shopping again, and I was asked to answer
the phone of the cap mistress rang up during there absence. She did, and
a month or so laterwe had occasion to recall oue pleasant chat. That
Tuesday, Lo had her dinner in her room. She had been crying after a
routine row with her mother and, as had happened on former occasions,
had not wished me to see her swollen eyes: she had one of those tender
complexions that after a good cry get all blurred and inflamed, and
morbid alluring. I regretted keenly her mistake about my private
aesthetics, for I simply love that tinge of Bottceillian pink, that raw
rose about the lips, those wet, matted eyelashes; and, naturally, her
bashful whim deprived me of many opportunities of specious consolation.
There was, however, more to it than I thought .As we sat in the darkness
of the veranda( a rude wind that had put out her red candles), Haze,
with a dreary laugh, said she had told Lo that her beloved humbert
thoroughly approved of the whole camp idea &quot;and now&quot;, added Hazed, &quot; the
child throws a fit:&quot;pretext: you and I want to get rid of her: actual
reason: I told her we could exchange tomorrow for a plainer stuff some
much too cute night things that she bullied me into buying for her. You
see, she sees herself as a starlet: I see her as sturdy, healthy, but
decidedly homely kids. Thus I guess, is at the root of our troubles.</p>
<p>On Wednesday I managed to waylay Lo for a few seconds: she was on the
landing, in sweatshirt and green-stained white shorts, rummaging, in a
trunk. I said somehthing meant to be friendly and funny but she only
emitted a snort without looking at me. Desperate, dying Humbert patted
her clumsily on her coccyx</p>

<p><strong>Foreword</strong></p>
<p><strong>^Lolita, or the Confession of a White Widowed Male,n</strong>
<strong>such were the two titles under wbicb the writer of the present
note received the strange pages it preambulates. ^Humbert
Humbert,</strong> <strong>&#x201D;</strong> <strong>their author had died in
legal captivity, of coronary thrombosis, on November i6y</strong>
<strong>1952, a fiw days before his trial was scheduled to start. His
laivyer, my goodfriend and relation, Clarence Choate Clark, Esq., now of
he Districf of Columbia bar, in asking me to edit the
manuscriptt</strong> <strong>based his request on a clause in his
client&apos;s will which empowered wiy eminent cousin to use his discretion
in all matters pertaining to the preparation cf^Lolittf for print. Mr.
Claris decision may have been influenced by the fact that the editor
ofhis choice hadjust been awarded the Poling Prize for a modest work
(ttDo the Senses make Sensed) therein certain morbid states and
perversions had been discussed.</strong></p>
<p><strong>My task proved simpler than either of us had anticipated.
Save for the correction cf obvious solecisms and a careful suppression
of a fiw tenacious details that despite &quot;H.H.</strong> <strong>ms oivn
efforts still subsisted in his text as signposts and tombstones
(indicative cfplaces or persons that taste i^ould conceal and compassion
spare), Ms remarkable memoir ispresented intact. Its author^ bizarre
cognomen is his own invention; and, cf course, this mask&#x2014;&#x2014;through
which</strong> <strong>&#x5982;&#x3002;hypnotic eyes seem to glow&#x2014;&#x2014;had to remain
unlifled in accordance u&#x5999;</strong> <strong>its rearer&apos;s uis&quot;
While</strong> <strong>ttHazen</strong> <strong>only rhymes with the
heroin^ real surname, her first name is too closely interwound with the
inmost fiber cfthe book to allow one to alter it; nor (as the reader
will perceive for himself) is there any practical necessity to do so.
References to</strong> <strong>aH.H.</strong> <strong>ms crime may be
looked up by the inquisitwe in the daily papers for September-October
1^2; its cause and purpose ^ould have continued to come under my reading
lamp.</strong></p>
<p><strong>For the benefit cf old-fashioned readers</strong>
&#x653B;&#x5FC5;&#x3002;<strong>wish to follow the destinies cfthe</strong>
<strong>vrealnpeople beyond, the</strong> <strong>Utruen</strong>
<strong>story, afiw details may be given as received from Mr.
&apos;&quot;Windmuller^ ofttRamsdale,</strong> <strong>fftwho desires his identity
suppressed so that &quot;the long shadow ofMs sorry and sordid business
should not reach the community to which he is proud to belong. His
daughter &apos;&apos;Louise^ is by no^ a college sophomore,</strong> <strong>uMona
Dahln</strong> <strong>is a student in Paris.</strong>
<strong>aRitan</strong> <strong>has recently married the proprietor cf a
hotel in Florida. Mrs. ^Richard F. Schillern</strong> <strong>died in
childbed, giving birth to a stillborn girl, on Christmas Day</strong>
<strong>&#x58EC;952, in Gray Star, a settlement in the remotest Northwest.
^Vivian Darkbloonf has written a biography,</strong> <strong>KMy Cue,&quot;
to be published shortly, and critics who haveperused the manuscript call
it her best book. The caretakers of the various cemeteries involved
report that no ghosts ijoalk.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Viewed simply as a novel, ^Lolita&apos; deals with situations and
emotions that would remain exasperatingly vague to the reader had their
expression been etiolated by means of platitudinous evasions. True, not
a single obscene term is to befound in the whole work; indeed^ the
robust philistine who is conditioned by modern conventions into
accepting without qualms a lavish array of four-letter uards in a banal
novel, will be quite shocked by their absence here, Ifi however, for
this paradoxical prude&apos;s comforty an editor attempted to dilute or omit
scenes that a certain type of mind might call</strong>
<strong>uaphrodisiacn</strong> <strong>(see in this respect the
monumental decision rendered December</strong> 6,<strong>1933, by Hon.
John M. Woolsey in regard to another considerably more outspoken^ book),
one would have to forego the publication cfaLolitcT altogether^ since
those very scenes that one might ineptly accuse ofsensuous existence of
their own, are the most strictly functional ones in the development cfa
tragic tale tending unswervingly to nothing less than a moral
apotheosis. The cynic may say that commercialpornography makes the same
claim; the learned may counter by asserting that</strong> <strong>ms
impassioned confession is a tempest in a test tube; that at
least</strong> <strong>12%</strong> <strong>cf American adult
males&#x2014;&#x2014;a</strong> <strong>aconser(vatieven</strong> <strong>estimate
according to Dr. Blanche Schwarzmann (verbal communication)&#x2014;enjoy
yearly, in one ijoay or another the special experience</strong>
<strong>HH.H.v</strong> <strong>describes with such despair; that had
our demented diarist in the fatai summer</strong> <strong>&#x7830;&#x5DE5;9</strong>
<strong>&#x574F;</strong> <strong>to a competent psycho-pathologist, there
would have been no disaster; but then, neither would there have been
this book.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This commentator may be excusedfor repeating what he has
stressed in his own books and lectures, namely that <sup>vffemwe</sup>
is frequently but a synonym for &apos;&quot;unusualf and a great ^ork of art is cf
course always original and thus by its very nature should come as a more
or less shocking surprise. I have no intention to glor^y &quot;H.H.nNo doubt,
he is horrible, he is abject, he is a shining example</strong> &#x77FF;
<strong>moral leprosy^ a mixture of ferocity andjocularity that betrays
supreme misery perhaps, but is not conducive to attractweness. He is
ponderously capricious. Many cfhis casual opinions on thepeople cmd
scenery of this country are ludicrous. A desperate honesty that throbs
through his confession does not absolve himfrom sins of diabolical
cunning. He is abnormal. He is not a gentleman. But hg magically his
singing violin can conjure up a tendressey</strong> <strong>a compassion
for Lolita that makes us entranced i^ith the book labile abhorring its
author!</strong></p>
<p><strong>As a case history,</strong> <strong>uLolitan</strong>
<strong>will become, no doubt, a classic in psychiatric circles. As a
work of arty it transcends its expiatory aspects; and still more
important to us than scientific significance and literary worthy is the
ethical impact the book should have on the serious reader; fir in this
poignant personal study there lurks a general lesson; the uayuard child,
the egotistic mother, the panting maniac&#x2014;these are not only vivid
characters in a unique story: they ^arn us of dangerous trends; they
point out potent evils. <sup>Lolit</sup> should make all cf us&#x2014;</strong>
<strong>arents, social workers, educators</strong>&#x4E00;<strong>apply
ourselves with still greater vigilance and vision to the task of
bringing up a better generation in a safer i^orld.</strong></p>

<p>Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul.
Lo-lee-ta: the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the
palate to tap, at three, on the teeth. Lo. Lee. Ta.</p>
<p>She was Lo, plain Lo, in the morning, standing four feet ten in one
sock. She was Lola in slacks. She was Dolly at school. She was Dolores
on the dotted line. But in my arms she was always Lolita.</p>
<p>Did she have a precursor? She did, indeed she did. In point of fact,
there might have been no Lolita at all had I not loved, one summer, a
certain initial girl-child. In a princedom by the sea. Oh when? About as
many years before Lolita was born as my age was that summer. You can
always count on a murderer for a fancy prose style.</p>
<p>Ladies and gendemen of the ju&#x529F; exhibit number one is what the
seraphs, the misinformed, simple, noble-winged seraphs, envied. Look at
this tangle of thorns.</p>
<p><strong><em>*2*</em></strong></p>
<p>I was born in 1910, in Paris. My father was a gende, easy-going
person, a salad of racial genes: a Swiss citizen, of mixed French and
Austrian descent, with a dash of the Danube in his veins. I am going to
pass around in a minute some lovely; glossyblue picture-postcards. He
owned a luxurious hotel on the Riviera. His father and two grandfathers
had sold wine, jewels and silk, respectively; At thirty he married an
English girl, daughter of Jerome Dunn, the alpinist, and granddaughter
of two Dorset parsons, experts in obscure subjects&#x2014;paleopedology and
Aeolian harps, respectively; My very photogenic mother died in a freak
accident (picnic, lightning) when I was three, and, save for a pocket of
warmth in the darkest past, nothing of her subsists within the hollows
and dells of memo% over which, if you can still stand my style (I am
writing under observation), the sun of my infancy had set: surely you
all know those redolent remnants of day suspended, with the midges,
about some hedge in bloom or suddenly entered and traversed by the
rambler, at the bottom of a hill, in the summer dusl^ a furry warmth,
golden midges.</p>
<p>My mothers elder sister; Sybil, whom a cousin of my fathers had
married and then neglected, served in my immediate family as a kind of
unpaid governess and housekeeper. Somebody told me later that she had
been in love with my father, and that he had lightheartedly taken
advantage of it one rainy day and forgotten it by the time the weather
cleared. I was extremely fond of her, despite the rigidity&#x2014;&#x2014;the fatal
rigidity&#x2014;of some of her rules. Perhaps she wanted to make of me, in the
fullness of time, a better widower than my father. Aunt Sybil had
pink-rimmed azure eyes and a waxen complexion. She wrote poetry. She was
poetically superstitious. She said she knew she would die soon after my
sixteenth birthday and did. Her husband, a great traveler in perfumes,
spent most of his time in America, where eventually he founded a firm
and acquired a bit of real estate.</p>
<p>I grew, a happ% healthy child in a bright would of illustrated books,
clean sand, orange trees, friendly dogs, sea vistas and smiling faces.
Around me the splendid Hotel Mirana revolved as a kind of private
universe, a whitewashed cosmos within the blue greater one that blazed
outside. From the aproned pot-scrubber to the flanneled potentate,
everybody liked me, everybody petted me. Elderly American ladies leaning
on their canes listed towards me like towers of Pisa. Ruined Russian
princesses who could not pay my father, bought me expensive bonbons. He,
<strong>mon cher petit papa,</strong> took me out boating and biking,
taught me to swim and dive and water-ski, read to me <strong>Don
Quixote</strong> and <strong>Les Miserable^</strong> and I adored and
respected him and felt glad for him whenever I overheard the servants
discuss his various lady-friends, beautiful and kind beings who made
much of me and cooed and shed precious tears over my cheerful
motherlessness.</p>
<p>I attended an English day school a few miles from home, and there I
played rackets and fives, and got excellent marks, and was on perfect
terms with schoolmates and teachers alike. The only definite sexual
events that I can remember as having occurred before my thirteenth
birthday (that is, before I first saw my little Annabel) were: a solemn,
decorous and purely theoretical talk about pubertal surprises in the
rose garden of the school with an American kid, the son of a then
celebrated motion-picture actress whom he seldom saw in the
three-dimensional world; and some interesting reactions on the part of
my organism to certain photographs, pearl and umbra, with infinitely
soft partings, in Pichons sumptuous <strong>Le Beaute Humaine</strong>
that that I had filched from under a mountain of marble-bound
<strong>Graphics</strong> in the hotel library; Later, in his delightful
debonair manner, my father gave me all the information he thought I
needed about sex; this was just before sending me, in the autumn of
1923, to a <strong>lycee</strong></p>
<p>in Lyon (where we were to spend three winters); but alas, in the
summer of that year; he was touring Italy with Mme de R. and her
daughter, and I had nobody to complain to, nobody to consult.</p>
<p><strong><em>*3*</em></strong></p>
<p>Annabel was, like the writer, of mixed parentage: half-English,
half-Dutch, in her case. I remember her features far less distinctly
today than I did a few years ago, before I knew Lolita. There are two
kinds of visual memory: one when you skillfully recreate an image in the
laboratory of your mind, with your eyes open (and then I see Annabel in
such general terms as: ahoney-colored skin,&quot; &quot;think arms,&#x201D; &quot;brown bobbed
hair,&quot; &#x201C;long lashes,&#x201D; &#x201C;big bright mouth&#x201D;)&#xFF1B; and the other when you
instantly evoke, with shut eyes, on the dark inner side of your eyelids,
the objective, absolutely optical replica of a beloved face, a little
ghost in natural colors (and this is how I see Lolita).</p>
<p>Let me therefore primly limit myself in describing Annabel, to saying
she was a lovely child a few months my junior. Her parents were old
friends of my aunt&apos;s, and as stuffy as she. They had rented a villa not
far from Hotel Mirana. Bald brown Mr. Leigh and fat, powdered Mrs. Leigh
(born Vanessa van Ness). How I loathed them! At first, Annabel and I
talked of peripheral affairs. She kept lifting handfuls of fine sand and
letting it pour through her fingers. Our brains were turned the way
those of intelligent European pre adolescents were in our day and set,
and I doubt if much individual genius should be assigned to our interest
in the plurality of inhabited worlds, competitive tennis, infinity
solipsism and so on. The softness and fragility of baby animals caused
us the same intense pain. She wanted to be a nurse in some famished
Asiatic country; I wanted to be a famous spy</p>
<p>All at once we were madl% clumsily shamelessly agonizingly in love
with each other; hopelessly I should add, because that frenzy of mutual
possession might have been assuaged only by our actually imbibing and
assimilating every particle of each others soul and flesh; but there we
were, unable even to mate as slum children would have so easily found an
opportunity to do. After one wild attempt we made to meet at night in
her garden (of which more later), the only privacy we were allowed was
to be out of earshot but not out of sight on the populous part of the
<strong>plage.</strong> There, on the soft sand, a few feet away from
our elders, we would sprawl all morning, in a petrified paroxysm of
desire, and take advantage of every blessed quirk in space and time to
touch each other: her hand, halShidden in the sand, would creep toward
me, its slender brown fingers sleepwalking nearer and nearer; then, her
opalescent knee would start on a long cautious journey; sometimes a
chance rampart built by younger children granted us sufficient
concealment to graze each other&apos;s salty lips; these incomplete contacts
drove our healthy and inexperienced young bodies to such a state of
exasperation that not even the cold blue water, under which we still
clawed at each other, could bring relief</p>
<p>Among some treasures I lost during the wanderings of my adult years,
there was a snapshot taken by my aunt which showed Annabel, her parents
and the staid, elderly; lame gentleman, a Dr. Cooper, who that same
summer courted my aunt, grouped around a table in a sidewalk cafe.
Annabel did not come out well, caught as she was in the act of bending
over her <strong>chocolat glace,</strong> and her thin bare shoulders
and the parting in her hair were about all that could be identified (as
I remember that picture) amid the sunny blur into which her lost
loveliness graded; but I, sitting somewhat apart from the rest, came out
with a kind of dramatic conspicuousness: a mood% beetle- browed boy in a
dark sport shirt and well-tailored white shorts, his legs crossed,
sitting in profile, looking away; That photograph was taken on the last
day of our fatal summer and just a few minutes before we made our second
and final attempt to thwart fate. Under the flimsiest of pretexts (this
was our very last chance, and nothing really mattered) we escaped from
the cafe to the beach, and found a desolate stretch of sand, and there,
in the violet shadow of some red rocks forming a kind of cave, had a
brief session of avid caresses, with somebody s lost pair of sunglasses
for only witness. I was on my knees, and on the point of possessing my
darling, when two bearded bathers, the old man of the sea and his
brother, came out of the sea with exclamations of ribald encouragement,
and four months later she died of typhus in Corfu.</p>
<p><strong><em>*4*</em></strong></p>
<p>I leaf again and again through these miserable memories, and keep
asking myself was it then, in the glitter of that remote summer, that
the rift in my life began; or was my excessive desire for that child
only the first evidence of an inherent singularity? When I try to
analyze my own cravings, motives, actions and so forth, I surrender to a
sort of retrospective imagination which feeds the analytic faculty with
boundless alternatives and which causes each visualized route to fork
and re-fork without end in the maddeningly complex prospect of my past.
I am convinced, however, that in a certain magic and fateful way Lolita
began with Annabel.</p>
<p>I also know that the shock of Annabels death consolidated the
frustration of that nightmare summer, made of it a permanent obstacle to
any further romance throughout the cold years of my youth. The spiritual
and the physical had been blended in us with a perfection that must
remain incomprehensible to the matter-of-fact, crude, standard-brained
youngsters of today; Long after her death I felt her thoughts floating
through mine. Long before we met we had had the same dreams. We compared
notes. We found strange affinities. The same June of the same year
(1919) a stray canary had fluttered into her house and mine, in two
widely separated countries. Oh, Lolita, had you loved me thus!</p>
<p>I have reserved for the conclusion of my &quot;Annabel&#x201D; phase the account
of our unsuccessful first tryst. One night, she managed to deceive the
vicious vigilance of her family; In a nervous and slender-leaved mimosa
grove at the back of their villa we found a perch on the ruins of a low
stone wall. Through the darkness and the tender trees we could see the
arabesques of lighted windows which, touched up by the colored inks of
sensitive memory; appear to me now like playing cards&#x4E00;presumably
because a bridge game was keeping the enemy busy She trembled and
twitched as I kissed the corner of her parted lips and the hot lobe of
her ear. A cluster of stars palely glowed above us, between the
silhouettes of long thin leaves; that vibrant s&#x5747; seemed as naked as she
was under her light frock. I saw her face in the sky; strangely
distinct, as if it emitted a faint radiance of its own. Her legs, her
lovely live legs, were not too close together, and when my hand located
what it sought, a dreamy and eerie expression, half-pleasure, half-pain,
came over those childish features. She sat a little higher than I, and
whenever in her solitary ecstasy she was led to kiss me, her head would
bend with a sleep% soft, drooping movement that was almost woeful, and
her bare knees caught and compressed my wrist, and slackened again; and
her quivering mouth, distorted by the acridity of some mysterious
potion, with a sibilant intake of breath came near to my face. She would
try to relieve the pain of love by first roughly rubbing her dry lips
against mine; then my darling would draw away with a nervous toss of her
hair, and then again come darkly near and let me feed on her open mouth,
while with a generosity that was ready to offer her everything, my
heart, my throat, my entrails, I have her to hold in her awkward fist
the scepter of my passion.</p>
<p>I recall the scent of some kind of toilet powder&#x2014;I believe she stole
it from her mother&apos;s Spanish maid&#x2014;&#x2014;a sweetish, lowly; musky perfume. It
mingled with her own biscuity odor, and my senses were suddenly filled
to the brim; a sudden commotion in a nearby bush prevented them from
overflowing&#x2014;and as we drew away from each other, and with aching veins
attended to what was probably a prowling cat, there came from the house
her mother&apos;s voice calling her, with a rising frantic note&#x2014;and Dr.
Cooper ponderously limped out into the garden. But that mimosa grove&#x2014;the
haze of stars, the tingle, the flame, the honey-dew; and the ache
remained with me, and that little girl with her seaside limbs and ardent
tongue haunted me ever since&#x2014;until at last, twenty-four years later, I
broke her spell by incarnating her in another.</p>
<p><strong><em>*5*</em></strong></p>
<p>The days of my youth, as I look back on them, seem to fly away from
me in a flurry of pale repetitive scraps like those morning snow storms
of used tissue paper that a train passenger sees whirling in the wake of
the observation car. In my sanitary relations with women I was
practical, ironical and brisk. While a college student, in London and
Paris, paid ladies sufficed me. My studies were meticulous and intense,
although not particularly fruitful. At first, I planned to take a degree
in psychiatry and many <strong>manque</strong> talents do; but I was
even more <strong>manque</strong> than that; a peculiar exhaustion, I am
so oppressed, doctor, set in; and I switched to English literature,
where so many frustrated poets end as pipe-smoking teachers in tweeds.
Paris suited me. I discussed Soviet movies with expatriates. I sat with
uranists in the <strong>Deux Magpts.</strong> I published tortuous
essays in obscure journals. I composed pastiches:</p>
<p>...Fraulein von Kulp</p>
<p>may turn, her hand upon the door;</p>
<p>I will not follow her. Nor Fresca. Nor</p>
<p>that Gull.</p>
<p>A paper of mine entitled &quot;The Proustian theme in a letter from Keats
to Benjamin Bailey&#x201D; was chuckled over by the six or seven scholars who
read it. I launched upon an <strong>aHistoire abregee de la poesie
anglaisen</strong> for a prominent publishing firm, and then started to
compile that manual of French literature for English-speaking students
(with comparisons drawn from English writers) which was to occupy me
throughout the forties&#x4E00;and the last volume of which was almost ready
for press by the time of my arrest.</p>
<p>I found a job&#x4E00;teaching English to a group of adults in Auteuil. Then
a school for boys employed me for a couple of winters. Now and then I
took advantage of the acquaintances I had formed among social workers
and psychotherapists to visit in their company various institutions,
such as orphanages and reform schools, where pale pubescent girls with
matted eyelashes could be stared at in perfect impunity remindful of
that granted one in dreams.</p>
<p>Now I wish to introduce the following idea. Between the age limits of
nine and fourteen there occur maidens who, to certain bewitched
travelers, twice or many times older than the/ reveal their true nature
which is not human, but nymphic (that is, demoniac); and these chosen
creatures I propose to designate as &quot;nymphets.&#x201D;</p>
<p>It will be marked that I substitute time terms for spatial ones. In
fact, I would have the reader see &quot;nine&#x201D; and Ufourteenw as the
boundaries&#x2014;the mirrory beaches and rosy rocks&#x2014;of an enchanted island
haunted by those nymphets of mine and surrounded by a vast, misty sea.
Between those age limits, are all girl-children nymphets? Of course not.
Otherwise, we who are in the know we lone voyagers, we nympholepts,
would have long gone insane. Neither are good looks any criterion; and
vulgarity or at least what a given community terms so, does not
necessarily impair certain mysterious characteristics, the fey grace,
the elusive, shifty soul-shattering, insidious charm that separates the
nymphet from such coevals of hers as are incomparably more dependent on
the spatial world of synchronous phenomena than on that intangible
island of entranced time where Lolita plays with her likes. Within the
same age limits the number of true nymphets is trickingly inferior to
that of provisionally plain, or just nice, or &quot;cute,&#x201D;or even &quot;sweet&#x201D;and
&quot;attractive,wordinary plumpish, formless, cold-skinned, essentially
human litde girls, with tummies and pigtails, who may or may not turn
into adults of great beauty (look at the ugly dumplings in black
stockings and white hats that are metamorphosed into stunning stars of
the screen). A normal man given</p>
<p>a group photograph of school girls or Girl Scouts and asked to point
out the comeli- est one will not necessarily choose the nymphet among
them. You have to be an artist and a madman, a creature of infinite
melancholy with a bubble of hot poison in your loins and a
super-voluptuous flame permanendy aglow in your subtle spine (oh, how
you have to cringe and hide!), in order to discern at once, by ineffable
signs&#x4E00;the slightly feline outline of a cheekbone, the slenderness of a
downy limb, and other indices which despair and shame and tears of
tenderness forbid me to tabulate&#x4E00;the little deadly demon among the
wholesome children; <strong>she</strong> stands unrecognized by them and
unconscious herself of her fantastic power.</p>
<p>Furthermore, since the idea of time plays such a magic part in the
matter, the student should not be surprised to learn that there must be
a gap of several years, never less than ten I should sa&#xBB; generally
thirty or fbrtj^ and as many as ninety in a few known cases, between
maiden and man to enable the latter to come under a nymphets spell. It
is a question of focal adjustment, of a certain distance that the inner
eye thrills to surmount, and a certain contrast that the mind perceives
with a gasp of perverse delight. When I was a child and she was a child,
my little Annabel was no nymphet to me; I was her equal, a faunlet in my
own right, on that same enchanted island of time; but today, in
September 1952, after twenty-nine years have elapsed, I think I can
distinguish in her the initial fateful elf in my life. We loved each
other with a premature love, marked by a fierceness that so often
destroys adult lives. I was a strong lad and survived; but the poison
was in the wound, and the wound remained ever open, and soon I found
myself maturing amid a civilization which allows a man of twenty- five
to court a girl of sixteen but not a girl of twelve.</p>
<p>No wonder, then, that my adult life during the European period of my
existence proved monstrously twofold. Overtly, I had so-called normal
relationships with a number of terrestrial women having pumpkins or
pears for breasts; inly I was consumed by a hell furnace of localized
lust for every passing nymphet whom as a law-abiding poltroon I never
dared approach. The human females I was allowed to wield were but
palliative agents. I am ready to believe that the sensations I derived
from natural fornication were much the same as those known to normal big
males consorting with their normal big mates in that routine rhythm
which shakes the world. The trouble was that those gentlemen had not,
and I <strong>had,</strong> caught glimpses of an incomparably more
poignant bliss. The dimmest of my pollutive dreams was a thousand times
more dazzling than all the adultery the most virile writer of genius or
the most talented impotent might imagine. My world was split. I was
aware of not one but two sexes, neither of which was mine; both would be
termed female by the anatomist. But to me, through the prism of my
senses, uthey were as different as mist and mast.&#x201D; All this I
rationalize now In my twenties and early thirties, I did not understand
my throes quite so clearly; While my body knew what it craved for, my
mind rejected my bodys every plea. One moment I was ashamed and
frightened, another recklessly optimistic. Taboos strangulated me.
Psychoanalysts wooed me with pseudoliberations of pseudoli- bidoes.The
fact that to me the only object of amorous tremor were sisters of
Annabels, her handmaids and girl-pages, appeared to me at times as a
forerunner of insanity. At other times I would tell myself that it was
all a question of attitude, that there was really nothing wrong in being
moved to distraction by girl-children. Let me remind my reader that in
England, with the passage of the Children and Young Person Act in 1933,
the term &quot;girl-child&#x201D; is defined as &quot;a girl who is over eight but under
fourteen years&quot; (after that, from fourteen to seventeen, the statutory
definition is &#x201C;young per- sorf,). In Massachusetts, U.S., on the other
hand, a &#x201C;wayward child&#x201D;is, technically one &quot;between seven and seventeen
years of age&#x201D; (who, moreover, habitually associates with vicious or
immoral persons). Hugh Broughton, a writer of controversy in the reign
of James the Rrst, has proved that Rahab was a harlot at ten years of
age. This is all very interesting, and I daresay you see me already
frothing at the mouth in a fit; but no, I am not; I am just winking
happy thoughts into a little tiddle cup. Here are some more pictures.
Here is Virgil who could the nymphet sing in a single tone, but probably
preferred a lads perineum. Here are two of King Akhnatens and Queen
Nefer- titi&apos;s pre-nubile Nile daughters (that royal couple had a litter
of six), wearing nothing but many necklaces of bright beads, relaxed on
cushions, intact after three thousand years, with their soft brown
puppybodies, cropped hair and long ebony eyes. Here are some brides of
ten compelled to seat themselves on the fascinum, the virile ivory in
the temples of classical scholarship. Marriage and cohabitation before
the age of puberty are still not uncommon in certain East Indian
provinces. Lepcha old men of eighty copulate with girls of eight, and
nobody minds. After all, Dante fell madly in love with Beatrice when she
was nine, a sparkling girleen, painted and lovely; and bejeweled, in a
crimson frock, and this was in 1274, in Florence, at a private feast in
the merry month of May; And when Petrarch fell madly in love with his
Laureen, she was a fair-haired nymphet of twelve running in the wind, in
the pollen and dust, a flower in flight, in the beautiful plain as
descried from the hills of Vaucluse.</p>
<p>But let us be prim and civilized. Humbert Humbert tried hard to be
good. Really and trul% he id. He had the utmost respect for ordinary
children, with their purity and vulnerability and under no circumstances
would he have interfered with the innocence of a child, if there was the
least risk of a <strong>row.</strong> But how his heart beat when, among
the innocent throng, he espied a demon child,<strong>uenfant charmante
etfourbe^</strong> dim eyes, bright lips, ten years in jail if you only
show her you are looking at her. So life went. Humbert was perfectly
capable of intercourse with Eve, but it was Lilith he longed for. The
bud-stage of breast development appears early (10.7 years) in the
sequence of somatic changes accompanying pubescence. And the next
maturational item available is the first appearance of pigmented pubic
hair (11.2 years). My little cup brims with tiddies.</p>
<p>A shipwreck. An atoll. Alone with a drowned passengers shivering
child. Darling, this is only a game! How marvelous were my fancied
adventures as I sat on a hard park bench pretending to be immersed in a
trembling book. Around the quiet scholar, nymphets played freely as if
he were a familiar statue or part of an old trees shadow and sheen. Once
a perfect little beauty in a tartan frock, with a clatter put her
heavily armed foot near me upon the bench to dip her slim bare arms into
me and tighten the strap of her roller skate, and I dissolved in the
sun, with my book for fig leaf^ as her auburn ringlets fell all over her
skinned knee, and the shadow of leaves I shared pulsated and melted on
her radiant limb next to my chameloenic cheek. Another time a red-haired
school girl hung over me in the metro, and a revelation of axillary
russet I obtained remained in my blood for weeks. I could list a great
number of these onesided diminutive romances. Some of them ended in a
rich flavor of hell. It happened for instance that from my balcony I
would notice a lighted window across the street and what looked like a
nymphet in the act of undressing before a co-operative mirror. Thus
isolated, thus removed, the vision acquired an especially keen charm
that made me race with all speed toward my lone gratification. But
abruptly fiendishly the tender pattern of nudity I had adored would be
transformed into the disgusting lamp- lit bare arm of a man in his
underclothes reading his paper by the open window in the hot, damp,
hopeless summer night.</p>
<p>Rope-skipping, hopscotch. That old woman in black who sat down next
to me on my bench, on my rack of joy (a nymphet was groping under me for
a lost marble), and asked if I had stomachache, the insolent hag. Ah,
leave me alone in my pubescent park, in my mossy garden. Let them play
around me forever. Never grow up.</p>
<p><strong><em>*6*</em></strong></p>
<p>A propos: I have often wondered what became of those nymphets later?
In this wrought-iron would of criss-cross cause and effect, could it be
that the hidden throb I stole from them did not affect their future? I
had possessed her&#x2014;and she never knew it. All right. But would it not
tell sometime later? Had I not somehow tampered with her fate by
involving her image in my voluptas? Oh, it was, and remains, a source of
great and terrible wonder.</p>
<p>I learned, however, what they looked like, those lovely^ maddening,
thin-armed nymphets, when they grew up. I remember walking along an
animated street on a gray spring afternoon somewhere near the Madeleine.
A short slim girl passed me at a rapid, high-heeled, tripping step, we
glanced back at the same moment, she stopped and I accosted her. She
came hardly up to my chest hair and had the kind of dimpled round litde
face French girls so often have, and I liked her long lashes and
tight-fitting tailored dress sheathing in pearl-gray her young body
which still retained&#x2014;and that was the nymphic echo, the chill of
delight, the leap in my loins&#x2014;a childish something mingling with the
professional <strong>fretillement</strong> of her small agile rump. I
asked her price, and she promptly replied with melodious silvery
precision (a bird, a very bird!) <strong>uCenLn</strong> I tried to
haggle but she saw the awful lone longing in my lowered eyes, directed
so far down at her round forehead and rudimentary hat (a band, a posy);
and with one beat of her lashes: <strong>u7antpis^</strong> she said,
and made as if to move away; Perhaps only three years earlier I might
have seen her coming home from school! That evocation settled the
matter. She led me up the usual steep stairs, with the usual bell
clearing the way for the <strong>monsieur</strong> who might not care to
meet another <strong>monsieury</strong> on the mournful climb to the
abject room, all bed and <strong>bidet. As</strong> usual, she asked at
once for her ?&#x6211;&#x886B; <strong>cadeauy</strong> and as usual I asked her
name (Monique) and her age (eighteen). I was pretty well acquainted with
the banal way of streetwalkers. They all answer <strong>udix-
huif</strong>&#x2014;a trim twitter, a note of finality and wistful deceit
which they emit up to ten times per da% the poor little creatures. But
in Moniques case there could be no doubt she was, if anything, adding
one or two years to her age. This I deduced from many details of her
compact, neat, curiously immature body. Having shed her clothes with
fascinating rapidity, she stood for a moment partly wrapped in the dingy
gauze of the window curtain listening with infantile pleasure, as pat as
pat could be, to an organ-grinder in the dust-brimming courtyard below;
When I examined her small hands and drew her attention to their grubby
fingernails, she said with a naive frown &#x201C;O&#x52FF;&#x516C; <strong>ce rfestpas
bien^</strong> and went to the wash-basin, but I said it did not matter,
did not matter at all. With her brown bobbed hair, luminous gray eyes
and pale skin, she looked perfectly charming. Her hips were no bigger
than those of a squatting lad; in fact, I do not hesitate to say (and
indeed this is the reason why I linger gratefully in that gauze- gray
room of memory with litde Monique) that among the eighty or so
<strong>grues</strong> I had had operate upon me, she was the only one
that gave me a pang of genuine pleasure. <strong>^Iletait malin, celui
qui a invents ce truc-la^</strong> she commented amiably and got back
into her clothes with the same high-style speed.</p>
<p>I asked for another, more elaborate, assignment later the same
evening, and she said she would meet me at the corner cafe at nine, and
swore she had never <strong>pose un lapin</strong> in all her young
life. We returned to the same room, and I could not help saying how very
pretty she was to which she answered demurely: <strong>&quot;Tues bien gentil
de dire</strong> p?&#x201D; and then, noticing what I noticed too in the mirror
reflecting our small Eden&#x2014;&#x2014;the dreadful grimace of clenched-teeth
tenderness that distorted my mouth&#x2014;dutiful little Monique (oh, she had
been a nymphet, all right!) wanted to know if she should remove the
layer of red from her lips <strong>avant qiion se couche</strong> in
case I planned to kiss her. Of course, I planned it. I let myself go
with her more completely than I had with any young lady before, and my
last vision that night of long-lashed Monique is touched up with a
gaiety that I find seldom associated with any event in my humiliating,
sordid, taciturn love life. She looked tremendously pleased with the
bonus of fifty I gave her as she trotted out into the April night
drizzle with Humbert Humbert lumbering in her narrow wake. Stopping
before a window display she said with great gusto: <strong>uJe vais
niacheter des basV</strong> and never may I forget the way her Parisian
childish lips exploded on <strong>abas^</strong> pronouncing it with an
appetite that all but changed the &#x201C;a&#x201D; into a brief buoyant bursting &quot;o&#x201D;
as in <strong>&quot;bof.</strong></p>
<p>I had a date with her next day at 2.15 p.m. in my own rooms, but it
was less successful, she seemed to have grown less juvenile, more of a
woman overnight. A cold I caught from her led me to cancel a fourth
assignment, nor was I sorry to break an emotional series that threatened
to burden me with heart-rending fantasies and</p>
<p>peter out in dull disappointment. So let her remain, sleek, slender
Monique, as she was for a minute or two: a delinquent nymphet shining
through the matter-of-fact young whore.</p>
<p>My brief acquaintance with her started a train of thought that may
seem pretty obvious to the reader who knows the ropes. An advertisement
in a lewd magazine landed me, one brave da% in the office of a Mlle
Edith who began by offering me to choose a kindred soul from a
collection of rather formal photographs in a rather soiled album
<strong>Regardez-moi cette belle brunet).</strong> When I pushed the
album away and somehow managed to blurt out my criminal craving, she
looked as if about to show me the door; however, after asking me what
price I was prepared to disburse, she condescended to put me in touch
with a person <strong>quipourrait arranger la chose.</strong> Next da%
an asthmatic woman, coarsely painted, garrulous, garlicky; with an
almost farcical Provencal accent and a black mustache above a purple
lip, took me to what was apparently her own domicile, and there, after
explosively kissing the bunched tips of her fat fingers to signify the
delectable rosebud quality of her merchandise, she theatrically drew
aside a curtain to reveal what I judged was that part of the room where
a large and unfas- tidious family usually slept. It was now empty save
for a monstrously plump, sallow, repulsively plain girl of at least
fifteen with red-ribboned thick black braids who sat on a chair
perfunctorily nursing a bald doll. When I shook my head and tried to
shuffle out of the trap, the woman, talking fast, began removing the
dingy woolen jersey from the young giantess* torso; then, seeing my
determination to leave, she demanded <strong>son ardent.</strong> A door
at the end of the room was opened, and two men who had been dining in
the kitchen joined in the squabble. They were misshapen, bare-necked,
very swarthy and one of them wore dark glasses. A small boy and a
begrimed, bowlegged toddler lurked behind them. With the insolent logic
of a nightmare, the enraged procuress, indicating the man in glasses,
said he had served in the police, <strong>luiy</strong> so that I had
better do as I was told. I went up to Marie&#x2014;for that was her stellar
name&#x2014;who by then had quietly transferred her heavy haunches to a stool
at the kitchen table and resumed her interrupted soup while the toddler
picked up the doll. With a surge of pity dramatizing my idiotic gesture,
I thrust a banknote into her indifferent hand. She surrendered my gift
to the ex-detective, whereupon I was suffered to leave.</p>
<p><strong><em>*7*</em></strong></p>
<p>I do not know if the pimps album may not have been another link in
the daisy-chain; but soon after, for my own safety I decided to marry.
It occurred to me that regular hours, home-cooked meals, all the
conventions of marriage, the prophylactic routine of its bedroom
activities and, who knows, the eventual flowering of certain moral
values, of certain spiritual substitutes, might help me, if not to purge
myself of my degrading and dangerous desires, at least to keep them
under pacific control. A little money that had come my way after my
fathers death (nothing very grand&#x2014;the Mi- rana had been sold long
before), in addition to my striking if somewhat brutal good looks,
allowed me to enter upon my quest with equanimity. After considerable
deliberation, my choice fell on the daughter of a Polish doctor: the
good man happened to be treating me for spells of dizziness and
tachycardia. We played chess; his daughter watched me from behind her
easel, and inserted eyes or knuckles borrowed from me into the cubistic
trash that accomplished misses then painted instead of lilacs and lambs.
Let me repeat with quiet force: I was, and still am, despite <strong>mes
malhenrs^</strong> an exceptionally handsome male; slow-moving, tall,
with soft dark hair and a gloomy but all the more seductive cast of
demeanor. Exceptional virility often reflects in the subject^
displayable features a sullen and congested something that pertains to
what he has to conceal. And this was my case. Well did I know alas, that
I could obtain at the snap of my fingers any adult female I chose; in
fact, it had become quite a habit with me of not being too attentive to
women lest they come toppling, bloodripe, into my cold lap. Had I been
<strong><sup>fran</sup>ais moyen</strong> with a taste for flashy
ladies, I might have easily found, among the many crazed beauties that
lashed my grim rock, creatures far more fascinating than X^leria. My
choice, however, was prompted by considerations whose essence was, as I
realized too late, a piteous compromise. All of which goes to show how
dreadfully stupid poor Humbert always was in matters of sex.</p>
<p><strong><em>*8*</em></strong></p>
<p>Although I told myself I was looking merely for a soothing presence,
a glorified <strong>pot-au- fiu,</strong> an animated merkin,what really
attracted me to Valeria was the imitation she gave of a little girl. She
gave it not because she had divined something about me; it was just her
style&#x2014;and I fell for it. Actually she was at least in her late twenties
(I never established her exact age for even her passport lied) and had
mislaid her virginity under circumstances that changed with her
reminiscent moods. I, on my part, was as naive as only a pervert can be.
She looked fluffy and frolicsome, dressed <strong>a la gamine^</strong>
showed a generous amount of smooth leg, knew how to stress the white of
a bare instep by the black of a velvet slipper, and pouted, and dimpled,
and romped, and dirndled, and shook her short curly blond hair in the
cutest and tritest fashion imaginable.</p>
<p>After a brief ceremony at the <strong>mairie9</strong>1 tool her to
the new apartment I had rented and, somewhat to her surprise, had her
wear; before I touched her, a girls plain nightshirt that I had managed
to filch from the linen closet of an orphanage. I derived some fun from
that nuptial night and had the idiot in hysterics by sunrise. But
reality soon asserted itself The bleached curl revealed its melanic
root; the down turned to prickles on a shaved shin; the mobile moist
mouth, no matter how I stuffed it with love, disclosed ignominiously its
resemblance to the corresponding part in a treasured portrait of her
toadlike dead mama; and presently instead of a pale litde gutter girl,
Humbert Humbert had on his hands a large, short-legged, big-breasted and
practically brainless <strong>baba.</strong></p>
<p>This state of affairs lasted from 1935 to 1939. Her only asset was a
muted nature which did help to produce an odd sense of comfort in our
small squalid flat: two rooms, a hazy view in one window a brick wall in
the other, a tiny kitchen, a shoe-shaped bath tub, within which I felt
like Marat but with no white-necked maiden to stab me. We had quite a
few cozy evenings together, she deep in her <strong>Paris-Soirf</strong>
I working at a rickety table. We went to movies, bicycle races and
boxing matches. I appealed to her stale flesh very seldom, only in cases
of great urgency and despair. The grocer opposite had a little daughter
whose shadow drove me mad; but with Valerias help I did find after all
some legal oudets to my fantastic predicament. As to cooking, we tacitly
dismissed <strong>pot-au-feu</strong> and had most of our meals at a
crowded place in rue Bonaparte where there were wine stains on the table
cloth and a good deal of foreign babble. And next door, an art dealer
displayed in his cluttered window a splendid, flamboyant, green, red,
golden and inlg blue, ancient American estampe&#x4E00;a locomotive with a
gigantic smokestack, great baroque lamps and a tremendous cowcatcher,
hauling its mauve coaches through the stormy prairie night and mixing a
lot of spark- studded black smoke with the furry thunder clouds.</p>
<p>These burst. In the summer of 1939 <strong>mon oncle
d&apos;Amerique</strong> died bequeathing me an annual income of a few
thousand dollars on condition I came to live in the States and showed
some interest in his business. This prospect was most welcome to me. I
felt my life needed a shake-up. There was another thing, too: moth holes
had appeared in the plush of matrimonial comfort. During the last weeks
I had kept noticing that my fat &#x5207;ileria was not her usual self; had
acquired a queer restlessness; even showed something like irritation at
times, which was quite out of keeping with the stock character she was
supposed to impersonate. When I informed her we were shortly to sail for
New York, she looked distressed and bewildered. There were some tedious
difficulties with her papers. She had a Nansen, or better say Nonsense,
passport which for some reason a share in her husbands solid Swiss
citizenship could not easily transcend; and I decided it was the
necessity of queuing in the <strong>prefecture^</strong> and other
formalities, that had made her so listless, despite my patiently
describing to her America, the country of rosy children and great trees,
where life would be such an improvement on dull dingy Paris.</p>
<p>We were coming out of some office building one morning, with her
papers almost in order, when Valeria, as she waddled by my side, began
to shake her poodle head vigorously without saying a word. I let her go
on for a while and then asked if she thought she had something inside.
She answered (I translate from her French which was, I imagine, a
translation in its turn of some Slavic platitude): aThere is another man
in my liW</p>
<p>Now, these are ugly words for a husband to hear. They dazed me, I
confess. To beat her up in the street, there and then, as an honest
vulgarian might have done, was not feasible. Years of secret sufferings
had taught me superhuman self-control. So I ushered her into a taxi
which had been invitingly creeping along the curb for some time, and in
this comparative privacy I quietly suggested she comment her wild talk.
A mounting fury was suffocating me&#x4E00;not because I had any particular
fondness for that figure of fun, <strong>Mme Humbert^</strong> but
because matters of legal and illegal conjunction were for me alone to
decide, and here she was, Valeria, the comedy wife, brazenly preparing
to dispose in her own way of my comfort and fate. I demanded her lover&apos;s
name. I repeated my question; but she kept up a burlesque babble,
discoursing on her unhappiness with me and announcing plans for an
immediate divorce. <strong>uMais qui est-ce^</strong> I shouted at last,
striking her on the knee with my fist; and she, without even wincing,
stared at me as if the answer were too simple for words, then gave a
quick shrug and pointed at the thick neck of the taxi driver. He pulled
up at a small cafe and introduced himselE I do not remember his
ridiculous name but after all those years I still see him quite
clearly&#x2014;a stocky White Russian ex-colonel with a bushy mustache and a
crew cut; there were thousands of them plying that fools trade in Paris.
We sat down at a table; the Tsarist ordered wine, and X^leria, after
applying a wet napkin to her knee, went on
talking&#x2014;&#x2014;<strong>into</strong> me rather than to me; she poured words
into this dignified receptacle with a volubility I had never suspected
she had in her. And every now and then she would volley a burst of
Slavic at her stolid lover. The situation was preposterous and became
even more so when the taxi-colonel, stopping Valeria with a possessive
smile, began to unfold <strong>his</strong> views and plans. With an
atrocious accent to his careful French, he delineated the world of love
and work into which he proposed to enter hand in hand with his
child-wife Valeria. She by now was preening herself between him and me,
rouging her pursed lips, tripling her chin to pick at her blousebosom
and so forth, and he spoke of her as if she were absent, and also as if
she were a kind of little ward that was in the act of being transferred,
for her own good, from one wise guardian to another even wiser one; and
although my helpless wrath may have exaggerated and disfigured certain
impressions, I can swear that he actually consulted me on such things as
her diet, her periods, her wardrobe and the books she had read or should
read. &quot;I think,&#x201D;&#x4E00;he said, &quot;She will like <strong>Jean
Christophe?&apos;</strong> Oh, he was quite a scholar, Mr. Taxovich.</p>
<p>I put an end to this gibberish by suggesting Valeria pack up her few
belongings immediately upon which the platitudinous colonel gallantly
offered to carry them into the car. Reverting to his professional state,
he drove the Humberts to their residence and all the way Valeria talked,
and Humbert the Terrible deliberated with Humbert the Small whether
Humbert Humbert should kill her or her lover, or both, or neither. I
remember once handling an automatic belonging to a fellow student, in
the days (I have not spoken of them, I think, but never mind) when I
toyed with the idea of enjoying his litde sister, a most diaphanous
nymphet with a black hair bow and then shooting myselE I now wondered if
Wlechka (as the colonel called her) was really worth shooting, or
strangling, or drowning. She had very vulnerable legs, and I decided I
would limit myself to hurting her very horribly as soon as we were
alone.</p>
<p>But we never were. Alechka&#x2014;by now shedding torrents of tears tinged
with the mess of her rainbow make-up,&#x2014;started to fill anyhow a trunk,
and two suitcases, and a bursting carton, and visions of putting on my
mountain boots and taking a run-</p>
<p>ning kick at her rump were of course impossible to put into execution
with the cursed colonel hovering around all the time. I cannot say he
behaved insolently or anything like that; on the contrary he displayed,
as a small sideshow in the theatricals I had been inveigled in, a
discreet old-world civility punctuating his movements with all sorts of
mispronounced apologies <strong>(j&apos;ai demande pardonne</strong>&#x2014;excuse
me&#x2014;&#x2014;<strong>est-ce que fai puis</strong>&#x4E00;may I&#x4E00;and so forth), and
turning away tactfully when Valechka took down with a flourish her pink
panties from the clothesline above the tub; but he seemed to be all over
the place at once, <strong>legredin,</strong> agreeing his frame with
the anatomy of the flat, reading in my chair my newspaper, untying a
knotted string, rolling a cigarette, counting the teaspoons, visiting
the bathroom, helping his moll to wrap up the electric fan her father
had given her, and carrying streetward her luggage. I sat with arms
folded, one hip on the window sill, dying of hate and boredom. At last
both were out of the quivering apartment&#x2014;&#x2014;the vibration of the door I
had slammed after them still rang in my every nerve, a poor substitute
for the backhand slap with which I ought to have hit her across the
cheekbone according to the rules of the movies. Clumsily playing my
part, I stomped to the bathroom to check if they had taken my English
toilet water; they had not; but I noticed with a spasm of fierce disgust
that the former Counselor of the Tsar, after thoroughly easing his
bladder, had not flushed the toilet. That solemn pool of alien urine
with a sogg}^ tawny cigarette butt disintegrating in it struck me as a
crowning insult, and I wildly looked around for a weapon. Actually I
daresay it was nothing but middle-class Russian courtesy (with an
oriental tang, perhaps) that had prompted the good colonel (Maximovich!
his name suddenly taxies back to me), a very formal person as they all
are, to muffle his private need in decorous silence so as not to
underscore the small size of his hosts domicile with the rush of a gross
cascade on top of his own hushed trickle. But this did not enter my mind
at the moment, as groaning with rage I ransacked the kitchen for
something better than a broom. Then, canceling my search, I dashed out
of the house with the heroic decision of attacking him barefisted;
despite my natural vigor, I am no pugilist, while the short but
broad-shouldered Maximovich seemed made of pig iron. The void of the
street, revealing nothing of my wifes departure except a rhinestone
button that she had dropped in the mud after preserving it for three
unnecessary years in a broken box, may have spared me a bloody nose. But
no matter. I had my litde revenge in due time. A man from Pasadena told
me one day that Mrs. Maximovich nee Zbo- rovski had died in childbirth
around 1945; the couple had somehow got over to California and had been
used there, for an excellent salary; in a year-long experiment conducted
by a distinguished American ethnologist. The experiment dealt with human
and racial reactions to a diet of bananas and dates in a constant
position on all fours. My infonnant, a doctor, swore he had seen with
his own eyes obese Valechka and her colonel, by then gray-haired and
also quite corpulent, diligently crawling about the well-swept floors of
a brightly lit set of rooms (fruit in one, water in another, mats in a
third and so on) in the company of several other hired quadrupeds,
selected from indigent and helpless groups. I tried to find the results
of these tests in the <strong>Review of Anthropology^</strong> but they
appear not to have been published yet. These scientific products take of
course some time to fluctuate. I hope they will be illustrated with
photographs when they do get printed, although it is not very likely
that a prison library will harbor such erudite works. The one to which I
am restricted these days, despite my lawyer&apos;s favors, is a good example
of the inane eclecticism governing the selection of books in prison
Ebraries. They have the Bible, of course, and Dickens (an ancient set,
N.Y., G.W. Dillingham, Publisher, MDCCCLXXXVII); and the
<strong>Childrens Encyclopedia</strong> (with some nice photographs of
sunshine-haired Girl Scouts in shorts), and <strong>A Murder Is
Announced</strong> by Agatha Christie; but they also have such
coruscating trifles as <strong>A vagabond in Italy</strong> by Percy
Elphinstone, author of <strong>Venice Revisited,</strong> Boston, 1868,
and a comparatively recent (1946) <strong>Who&apos;s Who in the
Limelight</strong>&#x2014;actors, producers, playwrights, and shots of static
scenes. In looking through the latter volume, I was treated last night
to one of those dazzling coincidences that logicians loathe and poets
love. I transcribe most of the page:</p>
<p>Pym, Roland. Born in Lundy; Mass., 1922. Received stage training at
Elsinore Playhouse, Der&#x5207; N.Y. Made debut in Sunburst. Among his many
appearances are <strong>Two Blocks from Here, The Girl in Green,
Scrambled Husbands, The Strange Mushroom, Touch and Go, John Lovely, I
Was Dreaming cfYou.</strong></p>
<p>Quilty; Clare, American dramatist. Bom in Ocean Cit^ N.J., 1911.
Educated at Columbia University; Started on a commercial career but
turned to playwriting. Author of <strong>The Little Nymph&gt; The Lady
Who Loved Lightning</strong> (in collaboration with Vivian Darkbloom),
<strong>Dark Aget</strong> <strong>The strange Mushroom, Fatherly
Love^</strong> and others. His many plays for children are notable.
<strong>Little Nymph</strong> (1940) traveled 14,000 miles and played
280 performances on the road during the winter before ending in New
Yjrk. Hobbies: fast cars, photography pets.</p>
<p>Quine, Dolores. Born in 1882, in Dayton, Ohio. Studied for stage at
American Academy; First played in Ottawa in 1900. Made New ^ork debut in
1904 in <strong>Never Talk to Strangers.</strong> Has disappeared since
in [a list of some thirty plays follows].</p>
<p>How the look of my dear loves name even affixed to some old hag of an
actress, still makes me rock with helpless pain! Perhaps, she might have
been an actress too. Born 1935. Appeared (I notice the slip of my pen in
the preceding paragraph, but please do not correct it, Clarence) in
<strong>The Murdered Playwright.</strong> Quine the Swine. Guilty of
killing Quilty; Oh, my Lolita, I have only words to play with!</p>
