<h2 id="the-costs-of-taming-price-rises-could-prove-too-unpalatable-for-central-banks">The
costs of taming price rises could prove too unpalatable for central
banks</h2>
<p>At first glance the world economy appears to have escaped from a
tight spot. In the United States annual inflation has fallen to 4%,
having approached double digits last year. A recession is nowhere in
sight and the Federal Reserve has felt able to take a break from raising
interest rates. After a gruesome 2022, stockmarkets have been
celebrating: the s&amp;p 500 index of American firms has risen by 14% so
far this year, propelled by a resurgence in tech stocks. Only in Britain
does inflation seem to be worryingly entrenched.</p>
<p>Listen to this story. Enjoy more audio and podcasts on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25">iOS</a> or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199">Android</a>.</p>
<p>The trouble is that the inflation monster has not truly been tamed.
Britain&#x2019;s problem is the most acute. There, wages and &#x201C;core&#x201D; prices,
which exclude energy and food, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/06/21/britains-inflation-pain-is-mostly-self-inflicted-and-getting-worse">are
rising</a> by around 7%, year on year. But even as headline rates
elsewhere have dropped as the energy shock has faded, core inflation has
been frustratingly stubborn. In both America and the euro area it
exceeds 5%, and has been high over the past year. Across the rich world
many governments are adding fuel to the fire by running budget deficits
of a scale typically seen during deep economic slumps.</p>
<p>As a result, central banks face agonising choices. What they do next
will reverberate across financial markets, threatening uncertainty and
upheaval for workers, bosses and pensioners.</p>
<p>Equity investors are hoping that central banks can return inflation
to their 2% targets without inducing a recession. But history suggests
that bringing inflation down will be painful. In Britain mortgage rates
are surging, causing pain to aspiring and existing homeowners alike.
Rarely has America&#x2019;s economy escaped unscathed as the Fed has raised
rates. By one reckoning, the unemployment rate would have to rise to
6.5% for inflation to come down to the Fed&#x2019;s target, the equivalent of
another 5m people being out of work. Rising interest rates imperil
financial stability in the euro area&#x2019;s most indebted member countries,
notably Italy.</p>
<p>Moreover, the secular forces pushing up inflation are likely to
gather strength. Sabre-rattling between America and China is leading
companies to replace efficient multinational supply chains with costlier
local ones. The demands on the public purse to spend on everything from
decarbonisation to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/06/22/can-the-west-build-up-its-armed-forces-on-the-cheap">defence</a>
will only intensify.</p>
<p>Central bankers vow that they are determined to meet their targets.
They could, by raising rates, destroy enough demand to bring inflation
down. Were they to keep their word, a recession would seem likelier than
a painless disinflation. But the costs of inducing a recession, together
with the longer term pressures on inflation, suggest another scenario:
that central banks seek to evade their nightmarish trade-off, by raising
rates less than is needed to hit their targets and instead <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/06/21/inflation-is-as-corrosive-to-investing-as-it-is-to-the-real-economy">living
with higher inflation</a> of, say, 3% or 4%.</p>
<p>This approach would resemble the &#x201C;opportunistic disinflation&#x201D;
espoused by some Fed governors in the late 1980s. Rather than
deliberately inducing recessions to bring inflation down, they sought to
do so passively, from cycle to cycle. Yet today&#x2019;s markets are not
prepared for such tactics. The pricing of inflation-linked Treasuries,
for instance, is consistent with average inflation expectations of 2.1%
over the next five years, and 2.3% in the five years thereafter. A world
of higher sustained inflation would therefore involve an epochal shift
for financial markets. Unfortunately, it would be volatile, wrong-foot
investors and pit winners against losers.</p>
<p>One source of volatility could stem from the damage to central banks&#x2019;
reputations. In the decades since the 1980s they have trumpeted their
commitment to targets. Yet over the past two years they have failed to
anticipate the persistence of inflation. Should they then pay lip
service to their unmet targets, they might no longer be taken at their
word. In time they could lose the ability to guide the expectations of
businesses and their workers. Those expectations could become unmoored
and cause lurches in prices, inducing inflation to spiral.</p>
<p>Volatile inflation would hurt companies, and their shares, by making
it harder for them to manage their costs and set prices. It would hurt
virtually every asset class by raising the likelihood that central banks
would have to rush to adjust rates after an unexpected flare-up. That
could bring large swings in real yields, prompting investors to demand a
discount in compensation for the uncertainty, forcing asset prices
down.</p>
<p>The new regime could wrong-foot investors in other ways, too. Were
central banks more lax, it would initially flatter the prices of
short-term bonds and push down their yields. In time, as the system
adjusted to higher inflation, nominal rates would rise to keep real
interest rates constant; in anticipation, the price of long-term bonds
would fall. Investors could rush into commodities, an inflation hedge.
Yet a stampede into the tiny market for futures, which are easier to
trade than physical barrels of oil, would risk a bubble.</p>
<p>Higher inflation would also create new winners and losers. Most
obviously, inflation involves an arbitrary transfer of wealth from
lenders to borrowers, as the real value of debt falls. Heavily indebted
borrowers, including governments around the world, may feel like
rejoicing. But as bond investors realised they were being stiffed, they
could punish recklessness with higher borrowing costs, including in rich
countries.</p>
<h2 id="sticker-shock">Sticker shock</h2>
<p>Other financial relationships could also become strained. If
inflation was gobbling up four percentage points of returns each year,
investors might start to look askance at fund managers&#x2019; fees. Rising
yields would improve the financial health of many defined-benefit
pension schemes, by reducing the present value of their future
liabilities. But benefits in retirement are not always fully protected
from inflation, meaning that the purchasing power of some pensions will
eventually be lower than expected. That would fuel voters&#x2019; ire.</p>
<p>Such is the excruciating situation that central banks now find
themselves in. They are likely to steer a course between high inflation
and recession. Investors seem to believe that this can still end well,
but the chances are that it won&#x2019;t. &#x25A0;</p>

        <p>This follwing contents are excerpted from the book &apos;Introduction to
Geography&apos; by Professor Arthur Getis fourteenth edition, the part of
climate issues, 4.6. Climate change, page 104~106, I put them because
they of high value and could be used a proof to disintegrate part of the
global climate apocalypse theory (something might be intentionally
fabricated).</p>
<h1 id="long-term-climate-change">Long-Term Climate Change</h1>
<p>Significantly variations in climate have occurred over geological
time. For example. Approximately 65 million years ago, there was a
sudden cooling of the earth&apos;s climate, this cooldown is thought to have
caused the extinction of some 75% of all existing plant and animal
species, including most dinosaurs. To take another example, cycles of
ice sheet formation and breakup occured at least five times during the
last ice age, which lasted 100000 years and ended only 11000 years
ago.</p>
<p>Climatologists have identified two major climatic periods just in
past 1000 years: a medieval warm period and a &quot;little ice age.&quot; Between
about A.D. 800 and 1200, during the medieval warm period, temperatures
were as warm as or warmer than they are now. Settlement and farming
expanded northward and to higher attitutes, the Vikings colonized
Iceland and Greenland, and vineyards flourished in Britain. During the
little ice age, which last from about A.D. 1300 to 1850, Arctic ice
expanded, glaciers advanced, drier areas of the earth were desiccated
(desiccated:having had all moisture removed; dried out.), and crop
failures and starvation were common.</p>
<p>Scientist have suggested that several explanations for such longterm
periodic changes in climate. Some of the climatic variations are thought
to be due to three aspects of the earth&apos;s motion, all of which affect
the amout of solar radiation reaching the planetary surface. First is
the shape of the earth&apos;s orbit around the sun, which varies from nearly
circular to more elliptical over a period of 100000 years. When the
orbit is nearly circular, the earth experiences relatively cold
temperatures. When it is elliptical, as it is now, the earth is closer
to the sun for several months, os exposed to greater total solar
radiation, and thus has higher temperatures.</p>
<p>Another cycle corresponds to the tilt of the earth&apos;s axis relative to
the orbital plane. The tilt varies from 21.5 degree to 24.5 degree every
41000 years. The amout of solar radiation striking polar regions changes
as the angle of tilt changes. A low tile position&#x2014;that is, a more
perpendicular position of the earth&#x2014;is accompanied by periods of colder
climate. Cooler climates are thought to be critical in the formation of
ice sheets.</p>
<p>Finally, like an unbalanced spinning top, the earth wobbles slights
as it rotates, changing the earth&apos;s orientation to the sun. The gyration
(a rapid movement in a circle or spiral; a whirling motion.) of the
rotation axis repeats every 23000 years. When the tilt of the axis is
greatest, the polar receive less solar radiation than they do at other
times and become colder.</p>
<h1 id="short-term-climate-change">Short Term Climate Change</h1>
<p>Climate can change more quickly and irregularly than the earth cycle
suggest. Great volcanic eruptions can alter climates for several years.
They spew enormous amout of ash, water vapor, sulfur dioxide, and other
gases into the upper atmosphere. As these solid and liquid particles
spread over much the planet, they block some of the incoming solar
radiation that normally would reach the earth&apos;s surface, producing a
cooling effect. The famous &quot;year without summer&quot; &#x2014;1816&#x2014;in New England,
when snow fell in June and frost came in July, probably was caused by
the eruption a year earlier of the Indonesian volcano Tambora. The
explosion ejected an estimated 200 million tons of gaseous aerosols and
50 cubic kilometers (30 cu mi) of dust and ash into the atmosphere. The
reflective cooling effect lasted for years. A similar decline in
temperatures occurred after the 1883 volcaniv eruption of Krakatoa, also
in Indonesia. A less extreme drop in temperatures in early 1990s was
attributed to the July 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the
Philippines, which lowered the average global temperature by about 0.5
celsius degree.(about 1 Fahrenheit degree).</p>
<p>Two other factors responsible for short-term climate changes are
alterations in patterns of oceanic circulation and sunspot activity. As
described on page 88, for example, during an El Ni&#xF1;o event, warm surface
waters from the western Pacific Ocean move eastward, changing the
climate along the western coasts of South and North America. Sunspots,
relatively cool regions on the surface of the sun, vary in number and
intensity over periods of years. They affect both the out put of solar
energy and the concentrations of ozone in the earth&apos;s upper
atmosphere.</p>
<h1 id="the-green-house-effect-and-global-warming-n.b.">The Green House
Effect and Global Warming ( N.B.)</h1>
<p>All of the cycles and factors we have discussed are natural
processes. In contrast, one of the most important questions has been
whether human beings are contributing to climate change through what is
popularly termed greenhouse effect. Put simply, the theory is that
certain gas concentrate in the atmosphere, where they function as an
insulating barrier, trapping infrared radiation that would otherwise be
radiated back into the upper atmosphere. In other words, like glass in a
green house, the gases admit incoming solar radiation but retard its
rediation back into space. You have experienced such a greenhouse effect
if you have gotten into a car that has been in the sun; the car&apos;s
interior is warmer than the outside car.</p>
<p>The earth has a natural greenhouse effect, provided mainly by water
vapor that has evaporated from the ocean or evaporations from the land.
The water vapor remains a constant, but during the past 150 years or so,
human activities have increased the amout of other greenhouse gases in
the atmosphere, augmenting its heat-trapping ability. Most scientists
fear that an enhanced greenhouse effect is responsible for a gradual
increase in the earth&apos;s average surface temperature, with significant
impacts on the earth&apos;s ecosystems, a process callled global warming.
That greenhouse effect is far less benign and nurturing than the name
implies.</p>
<p>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change(IPCC), made up of
thousands of scientists from about 120 countries, reported in May 2007
that:</p>
<p>Global atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide(CO2), methane,
and nitrous oxide have increased markedly as a result of human
activities since 1750 and now far exceed pre-industrial values
determined from ice cores spanning many thousands of years. The global
increase on CO2 concentration are due primarily to fossil use and land
use change, while those of methane and nitrous and primarily due to
agriculture.</p>
<p>Carbon Dioxide(CO2) is the primary greenhouse gas whose amount has
been increased by human activities. Although it occurs naturally,
excessive quantities of it are released by burning fossil fuels.
Beginning with the Industrial Revolution in the mid 1700s, large amout
of coal, petroleum, and natural gas have been burned to power industry,
to heat and cool cities, and to drive vehicles. Their combustion has
turned fules into carbon dioxide and water vapor. At the same time, much
of the world&apos;s forests have been destroyed by logging and to clear land
for agriculture. Deforestation adds to the greenhouse effect in two
ways: it means there are fewer trees to capture carbon dioxide and
produce oxygen, and burning the woods send the CO2 back into the at an
accelerated rate. The relative contribution of carbon dioxide to the
potential for global warming is about 55%.</p>
<p>Other important greenhouse gases influenced by human activity are</p>
<p>1.methane, from natural gas and coal mining, agriculture and
livestocks, swamps, and landfills.</p>
<p>2.nitrous oxides, from motor vehicles, industry, and
nitrogen-containing fertilizers</p>
<p>3.chlorofluorocarbons, hydrofluorocarbons, and perfluoro-carbons,
widely used industrial chemicals</p>
<p>Although these gases maybe present in small amouts, some of the trap
heat much more efficiently than does CO2. Nitrous oxide, for example,
has 360 times the capacity of CO2 to trap heat, and even methane is 24
times more potent than CO2 in absorbing heat close to the earth.</p>
<p>As the Industrial Revolution gained more momentum in Europe and North
America during the 19th century, the concentration of CO2 in the
atmosphere rose from its preindustrial level of about 274 parts per
million(ppm) to 315 ppm in 1958; it rose since then to 379 ppm in 2005.
The methane concentration in the lower atmosphere has already more than
doubled from its preindustrial level and its currently increasing by
just over 1% per year.</p>
<p>Scientists fear that the accelerated warming trend of past 50 years
has exceeded typical climate shifts and cite evidence such as the
following.</p>
<p>The 20th century wa the warmest century of past 600 years, and most
of its warmest years were concentrated near its end. The world&apos;s average
surface temperature rose about 0.6 celsius in the 20th century. This
pattern of warming has continued into current century.</p>

<p>hi and welcome to crash course u.s history a course that
approximately follows the ap u.s history curriculum as it appeared in
2013 and even though we call it u.s history we do begin before any
europeans show up in north america from the 15th century we&apos;ll take you
through every beat of the country&apos;s history until we reach barack
obama&apos;s presidency this will include all the well-known events we&apos;ll
learn about the revolutionary war the civil war women&apos;s suffrage the
world wars civil rights and so on but we&apos;ll introduce you to some
lesser-known events and people as well we&apos;ll do that via primary sources
that do a deep dive into how people were reacting to the time period
they were living through we&apos;ll also consider who was given the privilege
to have their reactions recorded because when citizens are marginalized
based on class gender or race that history isn&apos;t just history it touches
every part of the present so we&apos;ll learn it all together and try to make
sense of the united states complicated history oh and if jon gets the
mystery document wrong he&apos;ll be shocked literally.</p>
<h2 id="section">1</h2>
<p>Hi I&apos;m John Green, and this is Crash Course U.S. History!</p>
<p>No, Stan. That&apos;s not gonna work, actually.</p>
<p>I mean, we&apos;re talking about the 16th century today,when this was
neither united nor states.</p>
<p>By the way, this globe reflects the fact that I believe that Alaskan
statehood is illegitimate!</p>
<p>In fact, we&apos;re going to call this whole show &quot;U.S. History&quot;</p>
<p>but inevitably it is going to involve other parts of the world and
also, not to brag, a small part of the moon.</p>
<p>Sorry, we can be a little bit self-aggrandizing sometimes, here in
America.</p>
<p>So to begin U.S. history, we&apos;re not going to talk about the United
states or this guy.</p>
<p>We&apos;re going to talk about the people who lived here before any
Europeans showed up.</p>
<p>North America was home to a great variety of people so it&apos;s difficult
to generalize, but here&apos;s what we can say:</p>
<p>One, when the Europeans arrived there were no classical-style
civilizations with monumental architecture and empires like the Aztec or
the Incas.</p>
<p>And two, native North Americans had no metalwork, no gun powder, no
wheels, no written languages, and no domesticated animals.</p>
<p>However, they did have farming, complex social and political
structures, and widespread trade networks.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Mr. Green! Mr. Green! So they were pretty backwards, huh? Well, or I
mean at least primitive.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Primitive&quot; is a funny word, me from the past, because it implies a
romanticization --</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>these simple people who never used more than they needed and had no
use for guns. And it also implies an infantilization. It&apos;s like you
believe just because you have a beeper and they didn&apos;t they were somehow
less-evolved humans. But you can&apos;t see the human story as one that goes
from primitive to civilized. That&apos;s not just Eurocentric that&apos;s
contemporary-centric. The idea that we&apos;re moving forward as a species
implies a linear progression that just does not reflect the reality of
life on this planet. I get that you like to imagine yourself as the
result of millennia of advancement and the very pinnacle of human-ness,
but from where I&apos;m sitting that worldview is a lot more backwards than
living without the wheel. So no one knows exactly how many people lived
in North America before the Europeans got here. Some estimates are as
high as 75 million, but in the present US borders the guesses are
between 2 and 10 million. And like other Native Americans their
populations were decimated by diseases such as smallpox and influenza.
Actually it was much worse than decimation. As many of you have pointed
out, &quot;decimation&quot; means 1 in 10. This was much worse than that. It was
closer maybe to 8 in 10, which would be an &quot;octicimation.&quot; So there had
been civilizations in North America but they peaked before the Europeans
arrived. The Zuni and Hopi civilization roundabout here peaked</p>
<p>about 1200 CE.</p>
<p>They had large, multiple-family dwellings and canyons, which they
probably left because of drought. Crash Course World History fans will
remember that environmental degradation often causes the decline of
civilizations. I&apos;m looking at you, Indus Valley, and also you, entire
future Earth. Eut complex civilizations weren&apos;t the rule in North
America. And now we&apos;re about to begin generalizing, a bad habit
historians have partly because there&apos;s a limited historical record but
also because Eurocentric historians have a bad habit of primitivizing
and simplifying others. So I want to underscore that there was huge
diversity in the pre-Columbus American experience and that talking about
someone who lived here in 1000 BCE and talking about someone who lived
here 2,000 years later is just inherently problematic.</p>
<p>That said, let&apos;s go to the Thought Bubble: Most native groups in most
places organized as tribes, and their lives were dominated by the
natural resources available where they lived. So West Coast Indians
primarily lived by fishing, gathering, and hunting sea mammals; Great
Plains Indians were often buffalo hunters. These tribal bands often
united into loose confederacies or leagues, the best-known of which was
probably the Iroquois Confederacy, also called the Great League of
Peace. This was kind of like an upstate New York version of NATO but
without a nuclear weapons or the incessant international meddling or
Latvians-- Okay, it was nothing like NATO, actually. Religion usually
involved a vibrant spiritual world with ceremonies geared toward the
tribe&apos;s lifestyle: hunting tribes focused on animals, agricultural
tribes on good harvests. And most Indian groups believed in a single
creator god who stood above all the other deities, but they weren&apos;t
monotheistic in the way that Christians who came to the New World were.
American Indians also saw property very differently from Europeans. To
First Peoples, land was a common resource that village leaders could
assign families to use but not to own, and most land was seen as common
to everyone. As Blackhawk, a leader of the Sauk tribe, said, &quot;The Great
Spirit gave it to his children to</p>
<p>live upon and cultivate as far as necessary for their subsistence;
and so long as they occupy and cultivate it, they have a right to the
soil.&quot;</p>
<p>Thanks, Thought Bubble. Many of us tend to romanticize American
Indians as being immune from greed and class, but in fact there were
class distinctions in Indian tribes. Rulers tended to come from the same
families, for instance. That said, wealth was much more evenly
distributed than it was in Europe. And while most tribal leaders were
men, many tribes were matrilineal meaning that children became members
of their mother&apos;s family. Also women were often important religious
leaders. Women also often owned dwellings and tools, although not land
because again that idea did not exist. Also in many tribes women
engaging in premarital skoodilypooping wasn&apos;t taboo. In general they
were just much less obsessed with female chastity than Europeans were. I
mean I will remind you the first English settlement in America was
called &quot;Virginia.&quot; The idea that Native Americans were noble savages,
somehow purer than Europeans and untouched by their vices is not a new
one. Like some of the earliest European saw the Indians as paragons of
physical beauty and innocent of Europeans&apos; worst characteristics. But
for most Europeans there was little noble about what they saw as pure
Indian savagery. I mean Indians didn&apos;t have writing, they suffered from
the terrible character flaw of being able to have sex without feeling
ashamed, and most importantly they weren&apos;t Christians. The Spanish were
the first Europeans to explore this part of the world. Juan Ponce de
Le&#xF3;n arrived in what is now Florida in 1513 looking for gold and the
fabled Fountain of Youth. In 1521 he encountered a Calusa brave&apos;s
poison-tipped arrow and died before discovering that the Fountain of
Youth is of course delicious Diet Dr. Pepper. Mmm, ahh. I can taste all
23 flavors. There were many more Spanish explorers in the first half of
the 16th century including one &#xC1;lvar Nu&#xF1;ez Cabeza de Vaca, who wandered
through the American Southwest looking for gold, which I mentioned
entirely because I think that guy&apos;s last name means &quot;cow head.&quot; Of
course none of these people found any gold, but they did make later
European colonization easier by bringing over the microbes that wiped
out most native populations. So the Spanish wanted to colonize Florida
to set up military bases to thwart the pirates who preyed on
silver-laden Spanish galleons coming out of M&#xE9;xico. But Spanish
missionaries also came over hoping to convert local native populations.
This of course worked out magnificently. Just kidding, it went terribly.
Many of the missions were destroyed by an uprising of Guale Indians in
1597, and I will remind you mispronouncing things is my thing. In
general colonizing Florida sucked because it was hot and mosquito-y.
Spain was much more successful at colonizing the American Southwest. In
1610 Spain established its first permanent settlement in the southwest
at Santa Fe, New M&#xE9;xico. You couldn&apos;t really say that it flourished
since Santa Fe&apos;s population never got much above 3,000, but it had a
great small-town feel. New M&#xE9;xico is really important because it&apos;s the
site of the first large-scale uprising by Native Americans against
Europeans. I mean the native people, who the Spanish called &quot;Pueblos,&quot;
had seen their fortunes decline significantly since the arrival of
Europeans. How much decline? Well, between 1600 and 1680 their
population went from about 60,000 to about 17,000. Also the Franciscan
friars who came to convert the indigenous people became increasingly
militant about stamping out all native religion. The Spanish Inquisition
just wasn&apos;t very keen on the kind of cultural blending that made early
conversion efforts successful. So while the Spanish saw all the Pueblos
as one people they also knew there were tribal differences that made it
difficult for the Indians to unite and rise up against the Spanish. But
nothing unites like a common enemy, and in 1680 a religious leader named
Pop&#xE9; organized an uprising to drive the Spaniards out. Pop&#xE9; organized
about 2,000 warriors, who killed 400 Spanish colonists and forced the
rest to leave Santa Fe. So the Spanish colony in New M&#xE9;xico was
effectively destroyed. The Pueblos tore down all the Christian churches
and replaced them with kivas (their places of worship), but like most
awesome uprisings it didn&apos;t last. After the revolt the Spanish were much
more tolerant of indigenous religion, and they also abandoned the forced
labor practice called encomienda. Oh, it&apos;s time for the new Crash Course
feature the &quot;Mystery Document&quot;? How mysterious. The rules here are
simple: I read an attempt to identify the mystery document. If I am
right, I do not get shocked by this shock pen. And if I am wrong, I do.
Okay, what do we have here? &quot;The Indians were totally deprived of their
freedom and were put in the harshest, fiercest most horrible servitude
and captivity which no one who has not seen it can understand. Even
beasts enjoy more freedom when they are allowed to graze in the fields.
But our Spaniards gave no such opportunity to Indians and truly
considered them perpetual slaves. I sometimes came upon dead bodies on
my way, and upon others who were grasping and moaning in their death
agony repeating, &apos;Hungry, hungry.&apos; Andthis was the freedom, the good
treatment and the Christianity the Indians received.&quot; Well, that&apos;s nice.
Okay, so the mystery document is always a primary source, and since the
writer refers to &quot;our Spaniards&quot; I&apos;m going to guess that he or she
(probably he) is European and a Spaniards sympathetic to the Indians,
which narrows the list of suspects considerably. So it probably wasn&apos;t
de Sep&#xFA;lveda for instance, who argued that the Indians might not even be
human. Okay, Stan I&apos;m actually pretty confident here. I believe it is
from &quot;A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies&quot; by Bartolom&#xE9; de
las Casas. Ah, dang it! Stan just told me I have the author right but
the book wrong. It&apos;s &quot;A History of the Indies.&quot; Oh, I hate shocks, both
literal and metaphorical. So we focused a lot on the brutality of the
Spanish toward the Indians, but at least one Spaniard, de las Casas,
recognized that his countrymen were terrible. This realization is a good
thing, obviously, but it leads us to one of the big problems when it
comes to studying this time and place. The Black Legend is the tale that
the Spanish unleashed unspeakable cruelty on the Indians. Now, that tale
is true. But that idea was used by later settlers, especially the
English, to justify their own settlements. Like part of the reason they
needed to expand their empire was to save the Indians from the awful
Spanish, but were the English so much better? Yeah, probably not. As we
mentioned at the beginning of today&apos;s episode, American Indians didn&apos;t
have writing so we don&apos;t have records of their perspective. Now, some
Europeans like de las Casas were critical of the Spaniards, but most
considered the Indians heathens and implied or even outright said that
they deserved whatever horrible things befell them. So at the beginning
of our series I want to point out something that we need to remember
throughout: One of the great things about American history is that we
have a lot of written sources. This is the advantage of the U.S. coming
onto the scene so late in the game, historically speaking, But every
story we hear comes from a certain point of view. And we always need to
remember who is speaking, why they are speaking, and especially which
voices go unheard and why. Thanks for watching. I&apos;ll see you next
week.</p>
<h1 id="section-1">2</h1>
<p>Hi I&#x2019;m John Green, this is Crash Course US History,</p>
<p>and today we&apos;re going to tell the story of how a group of plucky
English people struck a blow for religious freedom,</p>
<p>and founded the greatest, freest and fattest nation the world has
ever seen.</p>
<p>[Libertage]</p>
<p>These Brits entered a barren land containing no people,</p>
<p>and quickly invented the automobile, baseball and Star Trek and we
all lived happily ever after.</p>
<p>Mr. Green, Mr. Green, if it is really that simple, I am so getting an
A in this class.</p>
<p>Oh, me from the past, you&apos;re just a delight.</p>
<p>[Theme Music]</p>
<p>So most Americans grew up hearing that the United States was founded
by pasty English people</p>
<p>who came here to escape religious persecution.</p>
<p>And that&apos;s true of the small proportion of people who settled in the
Massachusetts Bay</p>
<p>and created what we now know is New England.</p>
<p>But these Pilgrims and Puritans, there&apos;s a difference, weren&#x2019;t the
first people</p>
<p>or even the first Europeans to come to the only part of the globe we
didn&apos;t paint over.</p>
<p>In fact they weren&#x2019;t the first English people.</p>
<p>The first English people came to Virginia.</p>
<p>Off topic but how weird is it that the first permanent English colony
in the Americas was named</p>
<p>not for Queen Elizabeth&#x2019;s epicness but for her supposed chastity.</p>
<p>Right anyway, those first English settlers weren&apos;t looking for
religious freedom, they wanted to get rich.</p>
<p>So the first successful English colony in America was founded in
Jamestown, Virginia in 1607.</p>
<p>I say &quot;successful&quot; because there were two previous attempts to
colonize the region.</p>
<p>They were both epic failures.</p>
<p>The more famous of which was the colony of Roanoke Island set up by
Sir Walter Raleigh,</p>
<p>which is famous because all the colonists disappeared leaving only
the word &quot;Croatoan&quot; on carved into a tree.</p>
<p>Jamestown was a project of the Virginia Company,</p>
<p>which existed to make money for its investors, something it never
did.</p>
<p>The hope was that they would find gold in the Chesapeake region like
the Spanish had in South America,</p>
<p>so there were a disproportionate number of goldsmiths</p>
<p>and jewelers there to fancy up that gold which of course did not
exist.</p>
<p>Anyway, it turns out that jewelers dislike farming --</p>
<p>so much so, that Captain John Smith who soon took over control of the
island once said</p>
<p>that they would rather starve than farm.</p>
<p>So in the first year, half of the colonists died.</p>
<p>400 replacements came, but, by 1610, after a gruesome winter called
&quot;The Starving Time,&quot;</p>
<p>the number of colonists had dwindled to 65.</p>
<p>And eventually word got out that the new world&#x2019;s 1 year survival rate
was</p>
<p>like 20% and it became harder to find new colonists.</p>
<p>But 1618, a Virginia company hit upon a recruiting strategy called
the headright system</p>
<p>which offered 50 acres of land for each person that a settler paid to
bring over.</p>
<p>And this enabled the creation of a number of large estates,</p>
<p>which were mostly worked on and populated by indentured servants.</p>
<p>Indentured servants weren&apos;t quite slaves, but they were kind of
temporary slaves.</p>
<p>Like they could be bought and sold and they had to do what their
masters commanded.</p>
<p>But after seven to ten years of that, if they weren&apos;t dead,</p>
<p>they were paid their freedom dues which they hoped would allow them
to buy farms of their own.</p>
<p>Sometimes that worked out, but often either the money wasn&apos;t enough
to buy a farm,</p>
<p>or else they were too dead to collect it.</p>
<p>Even more ominously in 1619, just 12 years after the founding of
Jamestown,</p>
<p>the first shipment of African slaves arrived in Virginia.</p>
<p>So the colony probably would have continued to struggle along,</p>
<p>if they hadn&apos;t found something that people really loved: tobacco.</p>
<p>Tobacco had been grown in Mexico since at least 1000 BCE,</p>
<p>but the Europeans had never seen it and it proved to be kind of a</p>
<p>&quot;thank you for the small pox; here&apos;s some lung cancer&#x201D; gift from the
natives.</p>
<p>Interestingly King James hated smoking.</p>
<p>He called it &#x201C;a custom loathsome to the eye and hateful to the
nose&quot;</p>
<p>but he loved him some tax revenue, and nothing sells like drugs.</p>
<p>By 1624 Virginia was producing more than 200,000 pounds of tobacco
per year.</p>
<p>By the 1680s, more than 30 million pounds per year.</p>
<p>Tobacco was so profitable the colonists created huge plantations with
very little in the way of towns</p>
<p>or infrastructure to hold the social order together, a strategy that
always works out brilliantly.</p>
<p>The industry also structured Virginian society.</p>
<p>First off, most of the people who came in the 17th century,
three-quarters of them, were servants.</p>
<p>So Virginia became a microcosm of England:</p>
<p>a small class of wealthy landowners sitting atop a mass of
servants.</p>
<p>That sounds kind of dirty but it was mostly just sad.</p>
<p>The society was also overwhelmingly male, because male servants were
more useful in the tobacco fields,</p>
<p>they were the greatest proportion of immigrants.</p>
<p>In fact they outnumbered women 5 to 1.</p>
<p>The women who did come over were mostly indentured servants,</p>
<p>and if they were to marry, which they often did because they were in
great demand,</p>
<p>they had to wait until their term of service was up.</p>
<p>This meant delayed marriage which meant fewer children which further
reduced the number of females.</p>
<p>Life was pretty tough for these women, but on the upside Virginia was
kind of a swamp of pestilence,</p>
<p>so their husbands often died, and that created a small class of
widows or even unmarried women who,</p>
<p>because of their special status, could make contracts and own
property, so that was good, sort of.</p>
<p>OK. A quick word about Maryland.</p>
<p>Maryland was the second Chesapeake Colony, founded in 1632,</p>
<p>and by now there was no messing around with joint stock
companies.</p>
<p>Maryland was a proprietorship: a massive land grant to a single
individual named Cecilius Calvert.</p>
<p>Calvert wanted to turn Maryland into like a medieval feudal kingdom
to benefit himself and his family,</p>
<p>and he was no fan of the representational institutions that were
developing in Virginia.</p>
<p>Also Calvert was Catholic, and Catholics were welcome in Maryland
which wasn&apos;t always the case elsewhere.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, let&apos;s talk about Massachusetts.</p>
<p>So Jamestown might have been the first English colony, but
Massachusetts Bay is probably better known.</p>
<p>This is largely because the colonists who came there were so
recognizable for their beliefs and also for their hats.</p>
<p>That&#x2019;s right. I&#x2019;m talking about the Pilgrims and the Puritans.</p>
<p>And no, I will not be talking about Thanksgiving</p>
<p>...is a lie. I can&#x2019;t help myself.</p>
<p>But only to clear up the difference between Pilgrims and Puritans and
also to talk about Squanto.</p>
<p>God I love me some Squanto. Let&apos;s go to the Thought Bubble.</p>
<p>Most of the English men and women who settled in New England were
uber-Protestant Puritans</p>
<p>who believed the Protestant Church of England was still too
Catholic-y</p>
<p>with its kneeling and incense and extravagantly-hatted
archbishops.</p>
<p>The particular Puritans who, by the way did not call themselves that
-- other people did,</p>
<p>who settled in new England were called Congregationalists</p>
<p>because they thought congregations should determine leadership and
worship structures, not bishops.</p>
<p>The Pilgrims were even more extreme.</p>
<p>They wanted to separate more or less completely from the Church of
England.</p>
<p>So first they fled to the Netherlands, but the Dutch were apparently
too corrupt for them,</p>
<p>so they rounded up investors and financed a new colony in 1620.</p>
<p>They were supposed to land in Virginia, but in what perhaps should
have been taken as an omen,</p>
<p>they were blown wildly off course and ended up in what&apos;s now
Massachusetts, founding a colony called Plymouth.</p>
<p>While still on board their ship the Mayflower,</p>
<p>41 of the 150 or so colonists wrote and signed an agreement called
the Mayflower Compact,</p>
<p>in which they all bound themselves to follow &quot;just and equal laws&quot;
that their chosen representatives would write-up.</p>
<p>Since this was the first written framework for government in the US,
it&apos;s kind of a big deal.</p>
<p>But anyway, the Pilgrims had the excellent fortune of landing in
Massachusetts with 6 weeks before winter,</p>
<p>and they had the good sense not to bring very much food with them or
any farm animals.</p>
<p>Half of them died before winter was out.</p>
<p>The only reason they didn&apos;t all die was that local Indians led by
Squanto gave them food and saved them.</p>
<p>A year later, grateful that they had survived mainly due to the help
of an alliance with the local chief Massasoit,</p>
<p>and because the Indians had taught them how to plant corn and where
to catch fish,</p>
<p>the Pilgrims held a big feast: the first Thanksgiving. Thanks Thought
Bubble!</p>
<p>And by the way, that feast was on the fourth Thursday in
November,</p>
<p>not mid-October as is celebrated in some of these green areas we call
Not America.</p>
<p>Anyway Squanto was a pretty amazing character and not only because he
helped save the Pilgrims.</p>
<p>He found that almost all of his tribe, the Patuxet had been wiped out
by disease</p>
<p>and eventually settled with the Pilgrims on the site of his former
village and then died...</p>
<p>of disease because it is always ruining everything.</p>
<p>So the Pilgrims struggled on until 1691</p>
<p>when their colony was subsumed by the larger and much more successful
Massachusetts Bay Colony.</p>
<p>The Massachusetts Bay colony was chartered in 1629 by London
merchants who,</p>
<p>like the founders of the Virginia Company, hoped to make money.</p>
<p>But unlike Virginia, the board of directors relocated from England to
America,</p>
<p>which meant that in Massachusetts they had a greater degree of
autonomy and self-government than they did in Virginia.</p>
<p>Social unity was also much more important in Massachusetts than it
was in Virginia.</p>
<p>The Puritans&apos; religious mission meant that the common good was, at
least at first,</p>
<p>put above the needs or the rights of the individual.</p>
<p>Those different ideas in the North and South about the role of
government would continue...until now.</p>
<p>Oh God. It&apos;s time for the mystery document?</p>
<p>The rules are simple. I read the mystery document which I have not
seen before.</p>
<p>If I get it right, then I do not get shocked with the shock pen, and
if I get it wrong I do.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>&quot;We must be knit together in this work as one man, we must entertain
each other in brotherly affection,</p>
<p>we must be willing to abridge ourselves of our superfluities
(su-per-fluities? I don&apos;t know),</p>
<p>for the supply of others necessities,</p>
<p>we must uphold a familiar commerce together in all meekness,
gentleness, patience and liberality,</p>
<p>...for we must consider that we shall be as a city upon a hill, the
eyes of all people are upon us;</p>
<p>so that if we shall deal falsely with our god in this work we have
undertaken</p>
<p>and so cause him to withdraw his present help from us,</p>
<p>we shall be made a story and a byword through the world.&quot;</p>
<p>Alright, first thing I noticed: the author of this document is a
terrible speller</p>
<p>or possibly wrote this before English was standardized.</p>
<p>Also, a pretty religious individual.</p>
<p>And the community in question seems to embrace something near
socialism:</p>
<p>abridging the superfluous for others&apos; necessities.</p>
<p>Also it says that the community should be like a city upon a hill,
like a model for everybody.</p>
<p>And because of that metaphor, I know exactly where it comes from:</p>
<p>the sermon &quot;A Model of Christian Charity&quot; by John Winthrop.</p>
<p>Yes! Yes! No punishment!</p>
<p>This is one of the most important sermons in American history.</p>
<p>It shows us just how religious the Puritans were,</p>
<p>but it also shows us that their religious mission wasn&apos;t really one
of individualism but of collective effort.</p>
<p>In other words, the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few
or the one.</p>
<p>But this city on a hill metaphor is the basis for one kind of
American exceptionalism:</p>
<p>the idea that we are so special and so godly that we will be a model
to other nations,</p>
<p>at least as long, according to Winthrop, as we act together.</p>
<p>Lest you think Winthrop&#x2019;s words were forgotten,</p>
<p>they did become the centerpiece of Ronald Reagan&#x2019;s 1989 farewell
address.</p>
<p>Okay so New England towns were governed democratically,</p>
<p>but that doesn&apos;t mean that the Puritans were big on equality</p>
<p>or that everybody was able to participate in government because
no.</p>
<p>The only people who could vote or hold office were church
members,</p>
<p>and to be a full church member you had to be a &#x201C;visible saint&quot;,</p>
<p>so really, power stayed in the hands of the church elite. The same
went for equality.</p>
<p>While it was better than in the Chesapeake Colonies or England, as
equality went...eh, pretty unequal.</p>
<p>As John Winthrop declared, &quot;Some must be rich, and some poor.</p>
<p>Some high, an eminent in power, and dignity; others mean and in
subjection.&quot;</p>
<p>Or as historian Eric Foner put it</p>
<p>&quot;Inequality was considered an expression of God&apos;s will and while some
liberties applied to all inhabitants,</p>
<p>there were separate lists of rights for freemen, women, children and
servants.&quot;</p>
<p>There was also slavery in Massachusetts. The first slaves were
recorded in the colony in 1640.</p>
<p>However, Puritans really did foster equality in one sense.</p>
<p>They wanted everyone to be able to read the Bible.</p>
<p>In fact, parents could be punished by the town councils for not
properly instructing</p>
<p>their children in making them literate.</p>
<p>But when Roger Williams called for citizens to be able to practice
any religion they chose,</p>
<p>he was banished from the colonies.</p>
<p>So was Ann Hutchinson who argued the church membership should be
based on inner grace</p>
<p>and not on outward manifestations like church attendance.</p>
<p>Williams went on to found Rhode Island, so that worked out fine for
him,</p>
<p>but Hutchinson, who was doubly threatening to Massachusetts</p>
<p>because she was a woman preaching unorthodox ideas,</p>
<p>was too radical and was further banished to Westchester, New York
where she and her family were killed by Indians.</p>
<p>Finally, somebody who doesn&apos;t die of disease or starvation.</p>
<p>So Americans like to think of their country as being founded by
pioneers of religious freedom</p>
<p>who were seeking liberty from the oppressive English.</p>
<p>We&apos;ve already seen that&apos;s only partly true.</p>
<p>For one thing, Puritan ideas of equality and representation weren&apos;t
particularly equitable or representational.</p>
<p>In truth, America was also founded by indigenous people and by
Spanish settlers,</p>
<p>and the earliest English colonies weren&apos;t about religion; they were
about money.</p>
<p>We&apos;ll see this tension between American mythology and American
history again next week and also every week.</p>

<p>Hi I&apos;m John Green, this is Crash Course US History, and today we&apos;re
going to discuss Thomas Jefferson.</p>
<p>We&apos;re going to learn about how America became a thriving nation of
small, independent farmers,</p>
<p>eschewing manufacturing and world trade,</p>
<p>and becoming the richest and most powerful nation in the world in the
19th century, all thanks to the vision of Thomas Jefferson,</p>
<p>the greatest and most intellectually consistent Founding Father, who
founded the University of Virginia and grew 20 varieties of peas at
Monticello.</p>
<p>Me From the Past, get to your desk!</p>
<p>In a stunning turn of events, Me From the Past is an idiot and
Jefferson is more complicated than that.</p>
<p>[Theme Music]</p>
<p>So in 1800, Thomas Jefferson, pictured here &#x2013; this is the third time
that we&apos;ve featured Thomas Jefferson on the chalkboard, so we had to go
a little Warhol on it.</p>
<p>Right, so, Jefferson, the Republican, ran against John Adams, the
Federalist.</p>
<p>1800 was the first election where both parties ran candidates and
actually campaigned.</p>
<p>And, surprisingly, the Federalist&apos;s elitist strategy of &quot;vote for
Adams because he&apos;s better than you&quot; did not work.</p>
<p>Now, both parties realize that it was important to coordinate their
electoral strategy to make sure that the vice presidential candidate got
at least one fewer electoral votes than the presidential candidate.</p>
<p>But then the Republican elector who was supposed to throw his vote
away forgot to, so there ended up being a tie between Thomas Jefferson
and Aaron Burr.</p>
<p>As per the Constitution, the election went to the House of
Representatives, where it took 36 ballots and the intervention of
Alexander Hamilton before Jefferson was finally named president.</p>
<p>Incidentally, Burr and Hamilton really disliked each other, and not
in like, the passive-aggressive way that politicians dislike each other
these days,</p>
<p>but in the
four-years-later-they-would-have-a-duel-and-Burr-killed-Hamilton kind of
way.</p>
<p>A duel which occurred, wait for it, in New Jersey.</p>
<p>But anyway, shortly after the election of 1800, the 12th Amendment
was passed, making the Electoral College simpler, but not as simple as,
say, you know, one person&apos;s vote counting as one vote.</p>
<p>Anyway, complain about the Electoral College all you want, but
without it, we would never have had President Rutherford B. Hayes, and
just look at that beard!</p>
<p>So Jefferson became president and his election showed that Americans
wanted a more democratic politics, where common people were more free to
express their opinions.</p>
<p>The Federalists were never really a threat again in presidential
politics.</p>
<p>And, arguably, the best thing that John Adams ever did was transfer
power in an orderly and honorable way to his rival, Jefferson.</p>
<p>Jefferson&apos;s campaign slogan was &quot;Jefferson and Liberty,&quot; but the
liberty in question was severely limited.</p>
<p>Only a fraction of white men were allowed to vote and, of course,
there was no liberty for the slaves.</p>
<p>There&apos;s a lot of contentious debate on the subject of Jefferson and
slavery, but here&apos;s my two cents, which I should not be allowed to
contribute because we should only round to the nearest nickel, which, by
the way, features Thomas Jefferson.</p>
<p>So Thomas Jefferson was a racist and he wrote about black people&apos;s
inherent inferiority to whites and Native Americans, and the fact that
he fathered children with one of his slaves doesn&apos;t change that.</p>
<p>George Washington freed his slaves upon his death. Well, sort of.</p>
<p>They were supposed to be freed upon his wife&apos;s death, but living in a
house full of people who were waiting for you to die made Martha want to
free them while she was still alive.</p>
<p>But with few exceptions, Jefferson didn&apos;t free his slaves upon his
death and throughout his life, he used the sale of slaves to finance his
lavish lifestyle.</p>
<p>And this leads to two big philosophical questions when it comes to
history.</p>
<p>First, if Jefferson clearly did not think that black people were the
intellectual or moral equals of whites and was perfectly comfortable
keeping them in bondage,</p>
<p>then what does the most important phrase of the Declaration of
Independence actually mean?</p>
<p>And the second question is even broader:</p>
<p>Does it matter if a person of tremendous historical importance had
terrible aspects to their character?</p>
<p>Does being a bad person diminish your accomplishments?</p>
<p>I don&apos;t have a great answer for those questions, but I will tell you
that no remembers Richard Nixon for starting the EPA.</p>
<p>But this is very important to understand: Slaves were aware of
concept of liberty and they wanted it.</p>
<p>So in addition to an election, 1800 also saw one of the first
large-scale slave uprisings.</p>
<p>Gabriel&apos;s Rebellion was organized by a Richmond, Virginia blacksmith
who hoped to seize the capital, kill some of its inhabitants, and hold
the rest hostage until his demands for abolition were met.</p>
<p>But the plot was discovered before they could carry it out and
Gabriel, along with 25 other slaves, was hanged.</p>
<p>But after the rebellion, Virginians, if they didn&apos;t know it already,
were very aware that slaves wanted and expected liberty.</p>
<p>And the response was predictable: Virginia made its laws concerning
slaves much harsher.</p>
<p>It became illegal for slaves to meet in groups on Sundays unless
supervised by whites, and it became much more difficult for whites to
legally free their slaves.</p>
<p>Oh, it&apos;s time for the Mystery Document?</p>
<p>The rules here are simple:</p>
<p>Identify the author, no shock; fail to identify the author,
shock.</p>
<p>&quot;The love of freedom, sir, is an inborn sentiment, which the god of
nature has planted deep in the heart:</p>
<p>long may it be kept under by the arbitrary institutions of
society;</p>
<p>but, at the first favorable moment, it springs forth, and flourishes
with a vigour that defies all check.</p>
<p>This celestial spark, which fires the breast of the savage, which
glows in that of the philosopher, is not extinguished in the bosom of
the slave.</p>
<p>It may be buried in the embers; but it still lives; and the breath of
knowledge kindles it to flame.</p>
<p>Thus we find, sir, there have never been slaves in any country who
have not seized the first favorable opportunity to revolt.&quot;</p>
<p>I mean, from the bit at the beginning about the love of freedom, it
seems like it could be Jefferson, but the rest does not seem like
Jefferson.</p>
<p>Probably wasn&apos;t a slave, since they were denied access to education
precisely because the &quot;breath of knowledge&quot; is so dangerous to the
institution of slavery.</p>
<p>Oh, this is looking pretty bleak for me, Stan. Mmmmmm. John Jay?</p>
<p>[buzzing noise] Dang it!</p>
<p>Who was it? George Tucker?!</p>
<p>Who the John C. Calhoun is George Tucker?!</p>
<p>Is there a person watching this who knew that it was George
Tucker?</p>
<p>Fine! [electricity noise] Gah!</p>
<p>Apparently George Tucker was a member of the General Assembly of
Virginia and the Mystery Document was a description of Gabriel&apos;s
Rebellion that suggested a solution to the inherent problem of
rebellious slaves.</p>
<p>He argued that we should set up a colony for them in Indian territory
in Georgia, which, of course, also wouldn&apos;t have worked because we were
soon to steal that territory.</p>
<p>But back to Jefferson.</p>
<p>His idea was to make the government smaller, lower taxes, shrink the
military, and make it possible for America to become a bucolic,
agrarian, empire of liberty,</p>
<p>rather than an English-style, industrial, mercantile, nightmare
landscape.</p>
<p>So how did he do? Well, really well at first.</p>
<p>Jefferson got rid of all the taxes, except for the tariff, especially
the Whiskey Tax.</p>
<p>And then, when he woke up with a terrible, cheap whiskey-induced
hangover, he paid off part of the national debt.</p>
<p>He shrunk the army and the navy, and basically made sure that America
wouldn&apos;t become a centralized, English-style state for at least the next
60 years.</p>
<p>Low taxes and small government sounds great, but no navy?</p>
<p>That would be tough, especially when we needed ships and marines to
fight the Barbary pirates &quot;on the shores of Tripoli,&quot; who kept capturing
our ships in the Mediterranean and enslaving their crews.</p>
<p>This is yet another example of how foreign affairs keeps getting in
the way of domestic priorities;</p>
<p>in this case, the domestic priority of not wanting to spend money on
a navy.</p>
<p>Also, vitally, Jefferson&apos;s presidency really marks the last time in
history when a Republican president didn&apos;t want to spend money on the
military.</p>
<p>Don&apos;t get me wrong: Democrats can do it too. I&apos;m looking at you,
LBJ.</p>
<p>As much as he wanted to get rid of any trace of the Federalists,
Jefferson found himself thwarted by that imminently conservative and
undemocratic institution: the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Jefferson appointed Republicans to most government positions, but he
couldn&apos;t do anything about the Supreme Court because they serve for
life.</p>
<p>And since the country was only like, 12 years old, they were all
still pretty fresh.</p>
<p>Most important among them was Chief Justice John Marshall, who
happened to be a Federalist.</p>
<p>Marshall was Chief Justice basically forever and is, without
question, the most important figure in the history of the Supreme
Court.</p>
<p>He wrote a number of key opinions, but none was more important than
the 1803 decision in Marbury v. Madison.</p>
<p>Marbury v. Madison is so important because in that decision, the
Supreme Court gave itself the power of judicial review, which allows it
to uphold or invalidate federal laws.</p>
<p>The Court then extended this power to state laws in Fletcher v. Peck
and eventually even to executive actions.</p>
<p>Like, we think of the main job of the Supreme Court being to declare
laws unconstitutional, but that power isn&apos;t anywhere in the Constitution
itself.</p>
<p>Marbury v. Madison gave the Court that power and without it, the
Supreme Court would probably be a footnote in American history.</p>
<p>So unlike Marshall, Jefferson and the Republicans were big proponents
of strict construction:</p>
<p>the idea that the Constitution should be read as literally as
possible as way of limiting the power of the federal government.</p>
<p>The problem is, there might be things the government wants to do that
the Constitution didn&apos;t account for, like, for instance, buying a large
tract of land from Napoleon, who, as we remember from Crash Course World
History, complicates everything.</p>
<p>Let&apos;s go to the Thought Bubble.</p>
<p>So yeah, Jefferson basically doubled the size of the US in what came
to be known as the Louisiana Purchase.</p>
<p>Napoleon was eager to sell it, because the rebellion in Haiti had
soured him on the whole idea of colonies, and also because he needed
money.</p>
<p>Jefferson wanted to purchase New Orleans because western farmers were
shipping their products through the city and when he approached France
about this, Napoleon was like,</p>
<p>&quot;Hey! How bout I sell you, this!&quot;</p>
<p>Jefferson couldn&apos;t turn down that deal, so he bought the whole kit
and caboodle for $15 million, which is worth about $250 million
today.</p>
<p>To put that into perspective, a new aircraft carrier costs about $4.5
billion, so he got a good deal.</p>
<p>What&apos;s the problem with this?</p>
<p>Well, nothing if you believe in a powerful government that can do
stuff that&apos;s not in the Constitution.</p>
<p>But if you&apos;re a strict Constructionist like Jefferson, you have to
reconcile this obviously beneficial act with there being no mention in
the Constitution of the president being able to purchase land in order
to expand the size of the US.</p>
<p>So laying scruple aside, Jefferson bought Louisiana and then sent
Lewis and Clark to explore it, which they did, even going beyond the
boundaries of the Purchase all the way to the Pacific.</p>
<p>And this was so cool that it almost makes us forget that it was kind
of unconstitutional and a huge power grab for the president.</p>
<p>So the question is: why did he do it?</p>
<p>Jefferson&apos;s desire to increase the size of the country prompted
Federalists to complain that,</p>
<p>&quot;We are to give money, of which we have too little, for land, of
which we already have too much.&quot;</p>
<p>By doubling the size of the country, Jefferson could ensure that
there would be enough land for every white man to have his own small
farm.</p>
<p>And this, in turn, would ensure that Americans would remain
independent and virtuous.</p>
<p>Because only a small farmer who doesn&apos;t have to depend on the market
for food or shelter or anything really (well, except slaves), can be
truly independent, and thus capable of participating in a nation of free
men.</p>
<p>Thanks, Thought Bubble.</p>
<p>And this desire to create a nation of independent farmers producing
only primary products helps explains Jefferson&apos;s other incredibly
controversial policy: the embargo.</p>
<p>Jefferson imposed the embargo in order to punish Britain for its
practice of impressing American sailors, as well as its blockade of
France, with whom Britain was once again, or possibly just still, at
war.</p>
<p>So basically, Jefferson wanted free trade among nations and his
solution was to get Congress to forbid all American ships from sailing
to foreign ports.</p>
<p>The theory was that the British were so dependent on American primary
products, like wood and cotton, that if we cut off trade with them, the
British would stop impressing American sailors and end their
blockade.</p>
<p>What&apos;s the connection between free trade and Jefferson&apos;s agrarian
ideal?</p>
<p>Well, the idea was that America would trade its primary products for
Europe&apos;s manufactured goods, so that the US wouldn&apos;t have to develop any
manufacturing capacity of its own.</p>
<p>Alas, or perhaps fortunately, this did not work.</p>
<p>For one thing, Britain and France were too busy fighting each other
even to notice America&apos;s embargo.</p>
<p>So they just continued blockading and impressing.</p>
<p>Also, the embargo devastated the American economy.</p>
<p>I mean, exports dropped by 80%.</p>
<p>Furthermore, not being able to import European manufactured goods
only served to spur American manufacturing.</p>
<p>I mean, Jefferson might have wanted Americans to be a bunch of
self-sufficient farmers, but Americans wanted European manufactured
stuff, like teapots and clocks and microwaves.</p>
<p>Well, then how did they cook stuff, Stan?</p>
<p>And if they couldn&apos;t get that stuff from Britain, they would just
make it themselves.</p>
<p>So in terms of Jefferson&apos;s agrarian ideal, the embargo was a massive
failure.</p>
<p>And lastly, the embargo limited the power of the federal government
about as much as crystal meth limits cavities.</p>
<p>I mean, imposing the embargo was a colossal use of federal power and
it was also an imposition on people&apos;s liberties.</p>
<p>The problem the embargo was supposed to solve didn&apos;t go away and, as
we&apos;ll discuss next week, it eventually led to the US&apos;s first declared
war.</p>
<p>For now, I want to leave you with this: Thomas Jefferson is revered
and reviled in almost equal measure in American history.</p>
<p>The Declaration of Independence, which he mainly drafted, is a signal
achievement delineating some heroic ideas for the founding of the United
States, but also embedding some of its crucial shortcomings.</p>
<p>And Jefferson&apos;s presidency is like that too.</p>
<p>He claimed to champion small government, but he enlarged federal
power more than Washington or Adams ever did.</p>
<p>He imagined an agrarian republic, but his policies led to increased
manufacturing.</p>
<p>He wanted to foster freedom, but he owned slaves and took land from
the Indians.</p>
<p>In the end, Jefferson&apos;s life and policies encapsulate the best and
the worst of us, which is why his presidency is still worth studying
closely.</p>
<p>I&apos;ll see you next week.</p>
