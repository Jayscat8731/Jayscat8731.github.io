                <p>The world is in a total mess, no one can figure out a universal
resolution. what is right and what is wrong,why we are here, I can&apos;t
tell and I think it&apos;s impossible to tell. We are just floating here,you
and me , and everyone,anybody else,in the universe, in the name of,
nothing. the expression in the form of words might be doubtful,
unreliable as well. do we really exist? our existence might be only a
illusion. nothing really exists or ever existed. I can&apos;t see I can&apos;t
tell I can&apos;t hear I can&apos;t smell I can&apos;t fathom I can&apos;t imagine I can&apos;t
understand I can&apos;t know. I&apos;m dumb I&apos;m limp I&apos;m paralyzed I&apos;m deaf I&apos;m
blind I&apos;m primitive. wavering, oscillating all the time our existence is
an enigma.</p>
<p>&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>
<p>when someone saw something beautiful or something amazed him, I mean
as it is described as, amazed him, he must got his guts spurred,
intertwined, as like being scourged with an exploding sound to his
flesh, being shot, penetrated, shattered into numerous bloody fog up to
air, the air is filled with flying intestines, digestion systems,
dodecadactylon, mixed up with the stimulating, arousing scent of
epinephrine and ionic iron fragrance, that&apos;s succulent delicious smell
of the animal instinct of prey. explode and shine like a supernova.</p>
<p>&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>
<p>I heard the same sound in a local Lawson store which appears in the
preliminary seconds of this video, it reminds me of this video and stung
my soul to arouse an illusionary sceptical feeling against the reality
of life.I am confused with a phenomenon, why when people doubting about
the reality of their life, they will feel it frightening, same do I. why
it turns out to be a hallucinatory life more horrifying than that it&apos;s
real. why people are afraid of illusion more than reality or to say
adore reality more than illusion.</p>
<p>&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>
<p>it&apos;s my severest problem I mean when I&apos;m dealing with the business
with my secretly-attracted fancy I always act like a horrifically stupid
dumb moron, but it can also be used as a method to detect whether I&apos;m
really in feelings with someone.</p>
<p>&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>
<p>English is gradually taking place my first language, cause my
information resources are almost all in English, there&apos;s lots of English
news and information with much more high quality and accuracy, which
spared me much time for sifting, searching for better information about
what&apos;s really happening. I can&apos;t prove that the day I will Almost send
all the things in English and abandon the use of Chinese will not come
cause the fluency and proficiency and the frequency to use English is
going upwards through a very steady , long term development.and ,by the
way,I hate grammar. I hate that kind of learning mode most Chinese
schools are carrying on. that&apos;s a very boring, stupid way of learning
English. it can only demise, deteriorate the interest, keenness of
students in learning English.even me such kind of student with huge
amount passion and love in English will feel it extreme and disgusting
boring when I&apos;m studying English in the mode which traditional Chinese
education system always carries on. that&apos;s really a horrible mediocre,
dumb, silly kind of methodology. the innate character of this
traditional English learning methodology is actually a kind of mental
abuse.</p>
<p>&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>
<p>I mono-directionally blocked some of my we-chat friends from my
account(damn the fucking silly we-chat cant translate this beautifully)
but I actually browse their moments fiercely every day. I don&apos;t
understand why I would do this. maybe it&apos;s a kind of method to remind me
to browse them with voluntary inside driving force.</p>
<p>&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>
<p>&quot;you must got to be crazy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;you wrong, I haven&apos;t been in any means of rational sense since me
detaching the womb, or even right at the moment when the fertilization
is done. I&apos;m born to be the representative of havoc, lunacy, mayhem,
that&apos;s my destiny&quot;</p>
<p>&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>
<p>who&apos;s she? I can hardly remember. a fairy haunting around heart
vascular valve. I&apos;m living in crushing devastating illusionary addictive
evil charming sensual syrup foam storm blowing here, there and
everywhere, which blows me thousands miles away from home then takes me
back again, just like teasing an ant. I&apos;m rolling like tiny insensible
paralyzed finch, rolling in my aromatic vomits of colorful rose petals
which I&apos;ve swallowed in a fanatic mood seconds before.</p>
<p>&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>
<p>sometimes I doubt myself might be sliding into this world from
another parallel universe through a time&amp;space fissure by some means
of serendipity.</p>
<p>&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>
<p>This topic is relatively more related with the wealthier areas around
the world , especially among the developed countries in Europe, but not
in regions like developing countries, where the total literacy rates are
still increasing.</p>
<p>This is a nice and little complicated phenomenon, the education
standards is considered to rise up as the literacy and numeracy
improved, but now in some areas the situation is in reverse.</p>
<p>I think the most and roughly, essentially explanation to this
phenomenon is -----the requirements of high-level-required(not only
including mathematics, physics kind of logical subjects but also more
literary subject) specialized workforce has already reached to a
full-filling point, and even already exceeding the point, thus leading
to the problem of unemployment or hard&amp;deteriorating market
competition. Easily explained, we already have so much finest high-level
workforce and its already enough, no improvement will be made if more
such finest education groups are produced, and in reverse, and that&apos;s
what most developed countries always have to cope with is the severely
deteriorated level of old-aged society structure, thus maybe the society
requires more normal even below the average education level labour
force, mostly required in city basic operating areas like road-cleaning,
maintainence of basic appliance like metros, railway, river-cleaning,
food delivery etc. And as I know, the labor price is relatively much
higher in developed countries than in those developing countries.</p>
<p>And there&apos;s another reason as well. Suppose a student living in a
developing country, Its important for him to go into a good university
for the sake of his future mainly for seeking for a job much more easily
with a better degree----the better the degree is, the easier for him to
get a job, or a better job. The lively-hood is in the first class he
considers.</p>
<p>Then suppose a student living in a developed country, especially in a
country carries on strongly supported well-fare to thier citizens-----I
mean, even a citizen doesn&apos;t have to do much work, he will still be
living a relatively moderate happy life escaping from the problem a
developing country citizen may face that if he lose a job he wil then
have to face the problem of not enough income leading to the problem of
unable to pay for the rents, the general running costs for family for
most basic needs like clothes, water or food etc, and that&apos;s all the
problem a citizen in a developed country with highly developed well-fare
system hasn&apos;t need to worry about. Even he doesn&#x2019;t go to college for a
better degree he would not have to worry about the living, and that&apos;s
the different practical situation in different areas the citizens have
to face with.</p>
<p>Then comes to the discussion on the resolution to this problem. The
most direct tactic to cope with this----is to invest more and develop
more companies requiring high-tech education workforce to get rid of the
part of the the high-level workforce exceeding the need. And the
countries can cooperate together, giving better treatment and
specially</p>
<p>designed policies to transfer the high-level workforce from the
developed areas to developing areas, thus the benefits is two fold.</p>
<p>First, it can release the pressure of exceeding-need finest labour in
developed areas. Second, it can help the relatively undeveloped areas to
develop better, improving the condition of lacking high-level work
force. Both the region will benefit from this.</p>
<p>And the areas with exceeding finest labour can try to cut off the
ratio of the high-level majors operating in universities and try to add
more various subjects when then method can bring down the exceeding much
quantity of high- level labour force down from the womb.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the phenomenon that the education standards have
declined is a complicated and multi-areas relevant problem, the essence
of the problem is the exceeding-required quantity of high-level, finest
labour force.And the tactics to cope with is various mainly discussed
above consists of two ways. 1st, transferring the labour among areas
holding different needs for different kinds of labour from. 2st, cut the
production of such labour from womb----which means to cut off such
subjects in some universities and above all, the policies should be made
with much consideration and as carefully as possible.</p>

<p>I&apos;m my opinion, the current eastern force has not even a single tiny
possibility to gain the dictatorial global place in the future, all the
blasting boosting economic development is a miracle undeniable of
course, but its not actually sustainable. It&apos;s built mostly upon the
hardships of most low-rank working force and its almost disabled lacked
of the core competent high-tech which its strongly grabbing by the
western force which has the power to strangle our high-tech development
due to their will freely.</p>
<p>In my own opinion, and through my panoramic observations of the
circumstances right now playing on the stage, Donald Trump is very
likely to win the 2024 election, and if that really happens, the world
rules will be hugely rewritten. The democratic party will be strongly
beaten, and the dictatorship around the world will be facing a new and
much more tough and even devastating new cleaning force.But actually I&apos;m
not very sure about whether who plays a harder role against dictatorship
between democratic and Republicans. Maybe the situation right now it&apos;s
that both of them are playing a restraining influence to dictatorship,
but they have their own tactics. From my observations the democratic
strength is more likely to play hard with dictatorship at least under
the focus light but in the secret dark place its hard to say that they
are also irremediable at all. Maybe they have some secret dealings that
should be criticized. But the force of republicans led by Donald Trump
is likely to play a friendship at everybody&apos;s eyesight but stab them
very hard stealthily secretly and the people got stabbed behind even not
dare to shout it out.</p>

<p>My current capability in English is totally enough for me to fully
express my real feelings almost as genuine as my Chinese expressions and
that&apos;s wonderful, to achieve this also spent me much time and energy, a
huge amount of diligence on English learning for almost six years I
suppose I and I&apos;m not a deaf user I can also speak very well and
fluently but actually I got no English speaker to practice with me, most
of the time I only speak to myself. Suppose myself to be both the
teacher and students, giving myself questions and then answer them
myself. It seems like a lunatic murmuring to himself from a objective
view in a guy&apos;s perspective that not very familiar with me.As the
censorship should be more slight on English contents, I should resort
more English expressions in future and that&apos;s a method I should have
been discovered long time ago but I don&apos;t care I&apos;m still much young,
much remnants of life waiting for burning.</p>

<p>It&apos;s really something horrific nice and evil about Lolita, the accent

evilness, like a black rose, emitting luring and thin aromas that will

fineness of elegance is really fascinating</p>
<p>It is really a great pity for me that I might never be able to enjoy
or taste some of the finest sensual , exhilarating and agonized savors
some of the masters had once tasted. But to those prodigies, I suppose
the satisfaction is of course not the main gist of their life, but the
torments were. But how fascinating that tormenting feelings and smells
were and how attractive and addictive they were. I remember the smell of
perfume that once covered my body and soul for a short period in former
days . The evillish, luring ,elegant, small piece of aromas and the
golden sparkles shimmering in the darkened end of the tunnel of my
memory.</p>

<p>Due to my own experience and knowledge, whenever the government is
tempting to make a new policy, the influence will always be extremely
complicated and multilateral and the influence will sometimes develop
into a sequential stage that going out of the anticipation of the
policy-maker when the policy was made at first. Then here I will talk
about the influence mostly in the region of economics, otherwise the
passage will be too long and the time is also limited.</p>

<p>2023.7.16. Whoa, at this point I suppose I can try to type something,
cause I am now at this piont going on a brand new tour another time and
it really feels like kind weird, exciting stimulating or addictive. I am
on the train, or the highspeed train to Nanking, and this time I will
meet with a cute and well educated and well mannered, maybe kind
sophisticated little girl, but not quite little, if compared to my age
could be describe as an junior. But I suppose I am young as well, just
very a few years elder than her. And because of this, I have to take a
little bit of more consideration.</p>
<p>And I will go meet with my Bangladesh friend this time as well, and I
will also bring him to greet with my internet female friend. Maybe I can
introduce them to have some simple and interesting conversation.</p>
<p>And now, I am on the highspeed train, this time I bought the first
class, the first class is not quite expansive as I imagned before, only
a few 20 percent more than the normal one. But it actually feels not
bad, the air conditioning here is quite effective and strong,</p>
<p>And when I am walking around, walking outside, especially when I am
inside a group of people, I am always likely to possess some very
delicate and unexplicable feeling, and which is kind of very strong
feeling as well, which would almost strangle your soul or breath, a very
formidable yoke that likely to make you be overwelmed. To describe it
simply and as accurately as I can, it is mainly the feeling of
trenmendous gap or even an abyss between myself and this world,
especially the world of people, but not the world of universe. On the
contrary, I can always strongly feel my connection with the space and
time. During these days , I am trying to learn, to grasp and understand
the meaning of relativity from the most beginning. Now, I can grasp and
understand some of the most basic and shattered pieces, which at least
is true as well. The most overwhelming thing that I learned is about the
time, the illusion, and the hulluciantion of time. I remembered that
Eninstein said, &quot;Time is the most stubborn illusion, it dosen&apos;t really
exist , it is hallucinatory.&quot; And I kind doubt what is the feel right at
that moment when Eninstein discovered this as trueth, but my own feeling
is that, this is just horrifying , at least to the one that represents
myself at the point of time, it is just horrifying, I am really afraid
of the unreal thing, we are not really, all the things are just
hallucination, how frightening this just is.</p>
<p>Nothing, nothing, just could possibly be explained.</p>
<p>Damn it, now an obese girl just sat by myside, I discriminate them,
these days find that that I&apos;m not that quite nervous with the girls,
cause I know that they do not have the mysterity that I use to imagine,
they are just simply organized, without much complex, but from a higher
stratosphere, I think all the people are almost just the same to me,
maybe there would be slighly different in their complexion or oufit, but
insdie a deeper insight they are just in are kind of universal uniform,
totally the same, no matter their gener, age, genre, ethnic, the
language they speak, the color of their skin, their height all weight,
their voice etc. But I would really be interested to meet with people
like Albert Enenstein or Sergei Rachmaninoff. Some of though the very
few of the brains are destined to be speccially designed at the
beginning. And now my heart is slightly aching. During these years, or
to say around 2 or three years ago, I found that sometimes my heart
would ache, and this is a horryffing sign that symblise the beggining of
my aging, I am becoming old now, and someday I will die and decay into
minor pieces.</p>
<p>I hate it, but I dont suppose there&apos;s the need. You don&apos;t just have
to hate and love as well. There isn&apos;t really exsit the true meaning or
final purpose for the love or hatred. Nothing really matters. They would
disappear so fast and entirely, as never once existed or happened once
before. Thus, the grievement or the gaiety is the kind of temporary
illusion as well.</p>
<p>2023.7.24.</p>
<p>damn it this is jsut absurd I used to think thayt this is my
priveliged to scron someone else in the region of english but how
pathetically and savaged that what the heckI just have beeen met wiht ,
this just is absurd. what am I doing when I was at the age of 12 he says
it is not because that I tits is reallly triviial it is only becaus that
he donsnt just pruleyl interstrred into it taht is the only really and
teuu reasn wny kinf pf mertit id the modt sctragouobw have dyou edceyr
thought about thid befeor yI donre you must jiudt ahvent Han and now is
he is juat fucing typuing somehting wiht out any evne a little bit of
tangibler meainbg he is only acting tomake his omoauter souds all teh
time time , but nothin relly Hannah means anyithing tdhst bhe is just
fucnng [rifducun bavd evry felt the terx</p>
<p>&#x8FD9;&#x662F;&#x4E0D;&#x516C;&#x5E73;&#x7684;&#xFF0C;&#x53EF;&#x6076;</p>
<p>2023.7.29.</p>
<p>I don&apos;t know when will Mr. or teacher He will come. He said that the
time will be appointed at 9:30 and it is 20:56 now. From my former
knowledge on him, highly doubt that he will arrive on time.</p>
<p>And I am feeling stlighly or vehemently weird now. Some people there
are dancing, and girls take the most quantity of them. Se&#xF1;orita you see
it? What would Mr. He think or imagine when he is playing, or performing
on the stage at the same time observing the elegancies and adorable
gamines under the stage, right few meters away from him, twirking and
brandish their resilient and redolent, aromat bodies? His loins is tend
to be simmered by the vicious and viscuous flames.</p>
<p>So many people today, much more than the last time I come at least,
but this is actually something making me feeeling slightly uneasy,
because I would like to enjoy teache ho performance solely and
devotedly, and I do not wanna to be distracted by anything else than it,
The elegant perfriace, th elegant and delecate, exquisite performance,
so this is likely gonna become some part of my life in the future? And
take small imagination or fantasy that how did Mr hp once met and
acquainted wiht other girl, not people because it would be females for
sure. he is really fucking straight,</p>
<p>I kinda feeling like that I am somewhat lsoing the interst of writing
literature, I suppose mainly it i because of the courses and modes of
thinking I am taking these days, especially for the brain Science and
the biology of human hebaviour. Somewhat the most elegance, or elegancy,
that would something sounds more elegant and delicate. The acme of the
real......ok, keep it on anothet thing.</p>
<p>Mr, ho just greeted with me, he is asking me what am I doing here,
and I am typing something on my computer, thus he ask me waht am I
typing, I replied that I am typing about him, he says wow you are typing
all the contents In English, yeah, all in English and I even luxuriously
desiring to type it all in espa&#xF1;ol, or japanese, of cause it is possible
in the future, But still it has to take much longer time and
dedication.</p>
<p>Ok I am observing him talking some women a few metres away from me, I
am always fascinated in doing such observing experiment. If you a
stranger to Mr. ho, and you see him at the first sight, YOu will feel
how gentleman and well mannered and educated he is, but under his two
seemingly numb eyes, the flames of libido is always burning as the one
in the hell, when he is talking to women, he is really such polite and
moderate, well tempered and bounded inside a vast clothes, but from some
of the delicate and tiny details you can, maybe it is not you, it is
only me, or someone else with an extremely sensitive feeling of
observation, they are gping top detect something i going into astray,
whatever, not the original pure thing.</p>
<p>Well, people, so many, maing me feeling uneasy. Ok, enforece you
fierce weapon of brain science and biology of human behavior, what you
did learn&apos;t today or just now?</p>
