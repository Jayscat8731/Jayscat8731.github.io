                <p>adimir Nabokov. Lolita</p>
<p> Spellchecked by M. Avrekh, 21 Dec 1999</p>
<p> FOREWORD</p>
<p> &#x201C;Lolita, or the Confession of a White Widowed Male,&#x201D; such were the</p>
<p>two titles under which the writer of the present note received the strange</p>
<p>pages it preambulates. &#x201C;Humbert Humbert,&#x201D; their author, had died in legal</p>
<p>captivity, of coronary thrombosis, on November 16, 1952, a few days before</p>
<p>his trial was scheduled to start. His lawyer, my good friend and relation,</p>
<p>Clarence Choate Clark, Esq., now of the District of Columbia bar, in asking</p>
<p>me to edit the manuscript, based his request on a clause in his client&#x2019;s</p>
<p>will which empowered my eminent cousin to use the discretion in all matters</p>
<p>pertaining to the preparation of &#x201C;Lolita&#x201D; for print. Mr. Clark&#x2019;s decision</p>
<p>may have been influenced by the fact that the editor of his choice had just</p>
<p>been awarded the Poling Prize for a modest work (&#x201C;Do the Senses make</p>
<p>Sense?&#x201D;) wherein certain morbid states and perversions had been discussed.</p>
<p> My task proved simpler than either of us had anticipated. Save for the</p>
<p>correction of obvious solecisms and a careful suppression of a few tenacious</p>
<p>details that despite &#x201C;H.H.&#x201D;&#x2018;s own efforts still subsisted in his text as</p>
<p>signposts and tombstones (indicative of places or persons that taste would</p>
<p>conceal and compassion spare), this remarkable memoir is presented intact.</p>
<p>Its author&#x2019;s bizarre cognomen is his own invention; and, of course, this</p>
<p>mask&#x2013;through which two hypnotic eyes seem to glow&#x2013;had to remain unlifted</p>
<p>in accordance with its wearer&#x2019;s wish. While &#x201C;Haze&#x201D; only rhymes with the</p>
<p>heroine&#x2019;s real surname, her first name is too closely interwound with the</p>
<p>inmost fiber of the book to allow one to alter it; nor (as the reader will</p>
<p>perceive for himself) is there any practical necessity to do so. References</p>
<p>to &#x201C;H.H.&#x201D;&#x2018;s crime may be looked up by the inquisitive in the daily papers</p>
<p>for September-October 1952; its cause and purpose would have continued to</p>
<p>come under my reading lamp.</p>
<p> For the benefit of old-fashioned readers who wish to follow the</p>
<p>destinies of the &#x201C;real&#x201D; people beyond the &#x201C;true&#x201D; story, a few details may be</p>
<p>given as received from Mr. &#x201C;Windmuller,&#x201D; or &#x201C;Ramsdale,&#x201D; who desires his</p>
<p>identity suppressed so that &#x201C;the long shadow of this sorry and sordid</p>

<p>business&#x201D; should not reach the community to which he is proud to belong. His</p>
<p>daughter, &#x201C;Louise,&#x201D; is by now a college sophomore, &#x201C;Mona Dahl&#x201D; is a student</p>
<p>in Paris. &#x201C;Rita&#x201D; has recently married the proprietor of a hotel in Florida.</p>
<p>Mrs. &#x201C;Richard F. Schiller&#x201D; died in childbed, giving birth to a stillborn</p>
<p>girl, on Christmas Day 1952, in Gray Star, a settlemen in the remotest</p>
<p>Northwest. &#x201C;Vivian Darkbloom&#x201D; has written a biography, &#x201C;My Cue,&#x201D; to be</p>
<p>publshed shortly, and critics who have perused the manuscript call it her</p>
<p>best book. The caretakers of the various cemeteries involved report that no</p>
<p>ghosts walk.</p>
<p> Viewed simply as a novel, &#x201C;Lolita&#x201D; deals with situations and emotions</p>
<p>that would remain exasperatingly vague to the reader had their expression</p>
<p>been etiolated by means of platitudinous evasions. True, not a single</p>
<p>obscene term is to be found in the whole work; indeed, the robust philistine</p>
<p>who is conditioned by modern conventions into accepting without qualms a</p>
<p>lavish array of four-letter words in a banal novel, will be quite shocked by</p>
<p>their absence here. If, however, for this paradoxical prude&#x2019;s comfort, an</p>
<p>editor attempted to dilute or omit scenes that a certain type of mind might</p>
<p>call &#x201C;aphrodisiac&#x201D; (see in this respect the monumental decision rendered</p>
<p>December 6, 1933, by Hon. John M. Woolsey in regard to another, considerably</p>
<p>more outspoken, book), one would have to forego the publication of &#x201C;Lolita&#x201D;</p>
<p>altogether, since those very scenes that one might ineptly accuse of</p>
<p>sensuous existence of their own, are the most strictly functional ones in</p>
<p>the development of a tragic tale tending unswervingly to nothing less than</p>
<p>a moral apotheosis. The cynic may say that commercial pornography makes the</p>
<p>same claim; the learned may counter by asserting that &#x201C;H.H.&#x201D;&#x2018;s impassioned</p>
<p>confession is a tempest in a test tube; that at least 12% of American adult</p>
<p>males&#x2013;a &#x201C;conservative&#x201D; estimate according to Dr. Blanche Schwarzmann</p>
<p>(verbal communication)&#x2013;enjoy yearly, in one way or another, the special</p>
<p>experience &#x201C;H.H.&#x201D; describes with such despare; that had our demented diarist</p>
<p>gone, in the fatal summer of 1947, to a competent psycho-pathologist, there</p>
<p>would have been no disaster; but then, neither would there have been this</p>
<p>book.</p>
<p> This commentator may be excused for repeating what he has stressed in</p>
<p>his own books and lectures, namely that &#x201C;offensive&#x201D; is frequently but a</p>
<p>synonym for &#x201C;unusual;&#x201D; and a great work of art is of course always original,</p>
<p>and thus by its very nature should come as a more or less shocking surprise.</p>
<p>I have no intention to glorify &#x201C;H.H.&#x201D; No doubt, he is horrible, is is</p>
<p>abject, he is a shining example of moral leprosy, a mixture of ferocity and</p>
<p>jocularity that betrays supreme misery perhaps, but is not conducive to</p>
<p>attractiveness. He is ponderously capricious. Many of his casual opinions on</p>
<p>the people and scenery of this country are ludicrous. A desperate honesty</p>
<p>that throbs through his confession does not absolve him from sins of</p>
<p>diabolical cunning. He is abnormal. He is not a gentleman. But how magically</p>

<p>his singing violin can conjure up a tendresse, a compassion for Lolita that</p>
<p>makes us entranced with the book while abhorring its author!</p>
<p> As a case history, &#x201C;Lolita&#x201D; will become, no doubt, a classic in</p>
<p>psychiatric circles. As a work of art, it transcends its expiatory aspects;</p>
<p>and still more important to us than scientific significance and literary</p>
<p>worth, is the ethical impact the book should have on the serious reader; for</p>
<p>in this poignant personal study there lurks a general lesson; the wayward</p>
<p>child, the egotistic mother, the panting maniac&#x2013;these are not only vivid</p>
<p>characters in a unique story: they warn us of dangerous trends; they point</p>
<p>out potent evils. &#x201C;Lolita&#x201D; should make all of us&#x2013;parents, social workers,</p>
<p>educators&#x2013;apply ourselves with still greater vigilance and vision to the</p>
<p>task of bringing up a better generation in a safer world.</p>

<p> * PART ONE * </p>
<p> 1</p>
<p> Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul. Lo-lee-ta:</p>
<p>the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap,</p>
<p>at three, on the teeth. Lo. Lee. Ta.</p>
<p> She was Lo, plain Lo, in the morning, standing four feet ten in one</p>
<p>sock. She was Lola in slacks. She was Dolly at school. She was Dolores on</p>
<p>the dotted line. But in my arms she was always Lolita.</p>
<p> Did she have a precursor? She did, indeed she did. In point of fact,</p>
<p>there might have been no Lolita at all had I not loved, one summer, a</p>
<p>certain initial girl-child. In a princedom by the sea. Oh when? About as</p>
<p>many years before Lolita was born as my age was that summer. You can always</p>
<p>count on a murderer for a fancy prose style.</p>
<p> Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, exhibit number one is what the</p>
<p>seraphs, the misinformed, simple, noble-winged seraphs, envied. Look at this</p>
<p>tangle of thorns.</p>

<p> I was born in 1910, in Paris. My father was a gentle, easy-going</p>

<p>person, a salad of racial genes: a Swiss citizen, of mixed French and</p>
<p>Austrian descent, with a dash of the Danube in his veins. I am going to pass</p>
<p>around in a minute some lovely, glossy-blue picture-postcards. He owned a</p>
<p>luxurious hotel on the Riviera. His father and two grandfathers had sold</p>
<p>wine, jewels and silk, respectively. At thirty he married an English girl,</p>
<p>daughter of Jerome Dunn, the alpinist, and granddaughter of two Dorset</p>
<p>parsons, experts in obscure subjects&#x2013;paleopedology and Aeolian harps,</p>
<p>respectively. My very photogenic mother died in a freak accident (picnic,</p>
<p>lightning) when I was three, and, save for a pocket of warmth in the darkest</p>
<p>past, nothing of her subsists within the hollows and dells of memory, over</p>
<p>which, if you can still stand my style (I am writing under observation), the</p>
<p>sun of my infancy had set: surely, you all know those redolent remnants of</p>
<p>day suspended, with the midges, about some hedge in bloom or suddenly</p>
<p>entered and traversed by the rambler, at the bottom of a hill, in the summer</p>
<p>dusk; a furry warmth, golden midges.</p>
<p> My mother&#x2019;s elder sister, Sybil, whom a cousin of my father&#x2019;s had</p>
<p>married and then neglected, served in my immediate family as a kind of</p>
<p>unpaid governess and housekeeper. Somebody told me later that she had been</p>
<p>in love with my father, and that he had lightheartedly taken advantage of it</p>
<p>one rainy day and forgotten it by the time the weather cleared. I was</p>
<p>extremely fond of her, despite the rigidity&#x2013;the fatal rigidity&#x2013;of some of</p>
<p>her rules. Perhaps she wanted to make of me, in the fullness of time, a</p>
<p>better widower than my father. Aunt Sybil had pink-rimmed azure eyes and a</p>
<p>waxen complexion. She wrote poetry. She was poetically superstitious. She</p>
<p>said she knew she would die soon after my sixteenth birthday, and did. Her</p>
<p>husband, a great traveler in perfumes, spent most of his time in America,</p>
<p>where eventually he founded a firm and acquired a bit of real estate.</p>
<p> I grew, a happy, healthy child in a bright would of illustrated books,</p>
<p>clean sand, orange trees, friendly dogs, sea vistas and smiling faces.</p>
<p>Around me the splendid Hotel Mirana revolved as a kind of private universe,</p>
<p>a whitewashed cosmos within the blue greater one that blazed outside. From</p>
<p>the aproned pot-scrubber to the flanneled potentate, everybody liked me,</p>
<p>everybody petted me. Elderly American ladies leaning on their canes listed</p>
<p>towards me like towers of Pisa. Ruined Russian princesses who could not pay</p>
<p>my father, bought me expensive bonbons. He, mon cher petit papa, took</p>
<p>me out boating and biking, taught me to swim and dive and water-ski, read to</p>
<p>me Don Quixote and Les Miserables, and I adored and respected</p>
<p>him and felt glad for him whenever I overheard the servants discuss his</p>
<p>various lady-friends, beautiful and kind beings who made much of me and</p>
<p>cooed and shed precious tears over my cheerful motherlessness.</p>
<p> I attended an English day school a few miles from home, and there I</p>
<p>played rackets and fives, and got excellent marks, and was on perfect terms</p>
<p>with schoolmates and teachers alike. The only definite sexual events that I</p>

<p>can remember as having occurred before my thirteenth birthday (that is,</p>
<p>before I first saw my little Annabel) were: a solemn, decorous and purely</p>
<p>theoretical talk about pubertal surprises in the rose garden of the school</p>
<p>with an American kid, the son of a then celebrated motion-picture actress</p>
<p>whom he seldom saw in the three-dimensional world; and some interesting</p>
<p>reactions on the part of my organism to certain photographs, pearl and</p>
<p>umbra, with infinitely soft partings, in Pichon&#x2019;s sumptuous La Beaut&#xE8;</p>
<p>Humaine that that I had filched from under a mountain of marble-bound</p>
<p>Graphics in the hotel library. Later, in his delightful debonair</p>
<p>manner, my father gave me all the information he thought I needed about sex;</p>
<p>this was just before sending me, in the autumn of 1923, to a lyc&#xE8;e in</p>
<p>Lyon (where we were to spend three winters); but alas, in the summer of that</p>
<p>year, he was touring Italy with Mme de R. and her daughter, and I had nobody</p>
<p>to complain to, nobody to consult.</p>
<p> 3</p>
<p> Annabel was, like the writer, of mixed parentage: half-English,</p>
<p>half-Dutch, in her case. I remember her features far less distinctly today</p>
<p>than I did a few years ago, before I knew Lolita. There are two kinds of</p>
<p>visual memory: one when you skillfully recreate an image in the laboratory</p>
<p>of your mind, with your eyes open (and then I see Annabel in such general</p>
<p>terms as: &#x201C;honey-colored skin,&#x201D; &#x201C;think arms,&#x201D; &#x201C;brown bobbed hair,&#x201D; &#x201C;long</p>
<p>lashes,&#x201D; &#x201C;big bright mouth&#x201D;); and the other when you instantly evoke, with</p>
<p>shut eyes, on the dark inner side of your eyelids, the objective, absolutely</p>
<p>optical replica of a beloved face, a little ghost in natural colors (and</p>
<p>this is how I see Lolita).</p>
<p> Let me therefore primly limit myself, in describing Annabel, to saying</p>
<p>she was a lovely child a few months my junior. Her parents were old friends</p>
<p>of my aunt&#x2019;s, and as stuffy as she. They had rented a villa not far from</p>
<p>Hotel Mirana. Bald brown Mr. Leigh and fat, powdered Mrs. Leigh (born</p>
<p>Vanessa van Ness). How I loathed them! At first, Annabel and I talked of</p>
<p>peripheral affairs. She kept lifting handfuls of fine sand and letting it</p>
<p>pour through her fingers. Our brains were turned the way those of</p>
<p>intelligent European preadolescents were in our day and set, and I doubt if</p>
<p>much individual genius should be assigned to our interest in the plurality</p>
<p>of inhabited worlds, competitive tennis, infinity, solipsism and so on. The</p>
<p>softness and fragility of baby animals caused us the same intense pain. She</p>
<p>wanted to be a nurse in some famished Asiatic country; I wanted to be a</p>
<p>famous spy.</p>
<p> All at once we were madly, clumsily, shamelessly, agonizingly in love</p>
<p>with each other; hopelessly, I should add, because that frenzy of mutual</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (5 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:53file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>possession might have been assuaged only by our actually imbibing and</p>
<p>assimilating every particle of each other&#x2019;s soul and flesh; but there we</p>
<p>were, unable even to mate as slum children would have so easily found an</p>
<p>opportunity to do. After one wild attempt we made to meet at night in her</p>
<p>garden (of which more later), the only privacy we were allowed was to be out</p>
<p>of earshot but not out of sight on the populous part of the plage.</p>
<p>There, on the soft sand, a few feet away from our elders, we would sprawl</p>
<p>all morning, in a petrified paroxysm of desire, and take advantage of every</p>
<p>blessed quirk in space and time to touch each other: her hand, half-hidden</p>
<p>in the sand, would creep toward me, its slender brown fingers sleepwalking</p>
<p>nearer and nearer; then, her opalescent knee would start on a long cautious</p>
<p>journey; sometimes a chance rampart built by younger children granted us</p>
<p>sufficient concealment to graze each other&#x2019;s salty lips; these incomplete</p>
<p>contacts drove our healthy and inexperienced young bodies to such a state of</p>
<p>exasperation that not even the cold blue water, under which we still clawed</p>
<p>at each other, could bring relief.</p>
<p> Among some treasures I lost during the wanderings of my adult years,</p>
<p>there was a snapshot taken by my aunt which showed Annabel, her parents and</p>
<p>the staid, elderly, lame gentleman, a Dr. Cooper, who that same summer</p>
<p>courted my aunt, grouped around a table in a sidewalk cafe. Annabel did not</p>
<p>come out well, caught as she was in the act of bending over her chocolat</p>
<p>glac&#xE8;, and her thin bare shoulders and the parting in her hair were</p>
<p>about all that could be identified (as I remember that picture) amid the</p>
<p>sunny blur into which her lost loveliness graded; but I, sitting somewhat</p>
<p>apart from the rest, came out with a kind of dramatic conspicuousness: a</p>
<p>moody, beetle-browed boy in a dark sport shirt and well-tailored white</p>
<p>shorts, his legs crossed, sitting in profile, looking away. That photograph</p>
<p>was taken on the last day of our fatal summer and just a few minutes before</p>
<p>we made our second and final attempt to thwart fate. Under the flimsiest of</p>
<p>pretexts (this was our very last chance, and nothing really mattered) we</p>
<p>escaped from the cafe to the beach, and found a desolate stretch of sand,</p>
<p>and there, in the violet shadow of some red rocks forming a kind of cave,</p>
<p>had a brief session of avid caresses, with somebody&#x2019;s lost pair of</p>
<p>sunglasses for only witness. I was on my knees, and on the point of</p>
<p>possessing my darling, when two bearded bathers, the old man of the sea and</p>
<p>his brother, came out of the sea with exclamations of ribald encouragement,</p>
<p>and four months later she died of typhus in Corfu.</p>
<p> 4</p>
<p> I leaf again and again through these miserable memories, and keep</p>
<p>asking myself, was it then, in the glitter of that remote summer, that the</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (6 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:53file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>rift in my life began; or was my excessive desire for that child only the</p>
<p>first evidence of an inherent singularity? When I try to analyze my own</p>
<p>cravings, motives, actions and so forth, I surrender to a sort of</p>
<p>retrospective imagination which feeds the analytic faculty with boundless</p>
<p>alternatives and which causes each visualized route to fork and re-fork</p>
<p>without end in the maddeningly complex prospect of my past. I am convinced,</p>
<p>however, that in a certain magic and fateful way Lolita began with Annabel.</p>
<p> I also know that the shock of Annabel&#x2019;s death consolidated the</p>
<p>frustration of that nightmare summer, made of it a permanent obstacle to any</p>
<p>further romance throughout the cold years of my youth. The spiritual and the</p>
<p>physical had been blended in us with a perfection that must remain</p>
<p>incomprehensible to the matter-of-fact, crude, standard-brained youngsters</p>
<p>of today. Long after her death I felt her thoughts floating through mine.</p>
<p>Long before we met we had had the same dreams. We compared notes. We found</p>
<p>strange affinities. The same June of the same year (1919) a stray canary had</p>
<p>fluttered into her house and mine, in two widely separated countries. Oh,</p>
<p>Lolita, had you loved me thus!</p>
<p> I have reserved for the conclusion of my &#x201C;Annabel&#x201D; phase the account of</p>
<p>our unsuccessful first tryst. One night, she managed to deceive the vicious</p>
<p>vigilance of her family. In a nervous and slender-leaved mimosa grove at the</p>
<p>back of their villa we found a perch on the ruins of a low stone wall.</p>
<p>Through the darkness and the tender trees we could see the arabesques of</p>
<p>lighted windows which, touched up by the colored inks of sensitive memory,</p>
<p>appear to me now like playing cards&#x2013;presumably because a bridge game was</p>
<p>keeping the enemy busy. She trembled and twitched as I kissed the corner of</p>
<p>her parted lips and the hot lobe of her ear. A cluster of stars palely</p>
<p>glowed above us, between the silhouettes of long thin leaves; that vibrant</p>
<p>sky seemed as naked as she was under her light frock. I saw her face in the</p>
<p>sky, strangely distinct, as if it emitted a faint radiance of its own. Her</p>
<p>legs, her lovely live legs, were not too close together, and when my hand</p>
<p>located what it sought, a dreamy and eerie expression, half-pleasure,</p>
<p>half-pain, came over those childish features. She sat a little higher than</p>
<p>I, and whenever in her solitary ecstasy she was led to kiss me, her head</p>
<p>would bend with a sleepy, soft, drooping movement that was almost woeful,</p>
<p>and her bare knees caught and compressed my wrist, and slackened again; and</p>
<p>her quivering mouth, distorted by the acridity of some mysterious potion,</p>
<p>with a sibilant intake of breath came near to my face. She would try to</p>
<p>relieve the pain of love by first roughly rubbing her dry lips against mine;</p>
<p>then my darling would draw away with a nervous toss of her hair, and then</p>
<p>again come darkly near and let me feed on her open mouth, while with a</p>
<p>generosity that was ready to offer her everything, my heart, my throat, my</p>
<p>entrails, I have her to hold in her awkward fist the scepter of my passion.</p>
<p> I recall the scent of some kind of toilet powder&#x2013;I believe she stole</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (7 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:53file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>it from her mother&#x2019;s Spanish maid&#x2013;a sweetish, lowly, musky perfume. It</p>
<p>mingled with her own biscuity odor, and my senses were suddenly filled to</p>
<p>the brim; a sudden commotion in a nearby bush prevented them from</p>
<p>overflowing&#x2013;and as we drew away from each other, and with aching veins</p>
<p>attended to what was probably a prowling cat, there came from the house her</p>
<p>mother&#x2019;s voice calling her, with a rising frantic note&#x2013;and Dr. Cooper</p>
<p>ponderously limped out into the garden. But that mimosa grove&#x2013;the haze of</p>
<p>stars, the tingle, the flame, the honey-dew, and the ache remained with me,</p>
<p>and that little girl with her seaside limbs and ardent tongue haunted me</p>
<p>ever since&#x2013;until at last, twenty-four years later, I broke her spell by</p>
<p>incarnating her in another.</p>
<p> 5</p>
<p> The days of my youth, as I look back on them, seem to fly away from me</p>
<p>in a flurry of pale repetitive scraps like those morning snow storms of used</p>
<p>tissue paper that a train passenger sees whirling in the wake of the</p>
<p>observation car. In my sanitary relations with women I was practical,</p>
<p>ironical and brisk. While a college student, in London and Paris, paid</p>
<p>ladies sufficed me. My studies were meticulous and intense, although not</p>
<p>particularly fruitful. At first, I planned to take a degree in psychiatry</p>
<p>and many manqu&#xE8; talents do; but I was even more manqu&#xE8; than</p>
<p>that; a peculiar exhaustion, I am so oppressed, doctor, set in; and I</p>
<p>switched to English literature, where so many frustrated poets end as</p>
<p>pipe-smoking teachers in tweeds. Paris suited me. I discussed Soviet movies</p>
<p>with expatriates. I sat with uranists in the Deux Magots. I published</p>
<p>tortuous essays in obscure journals. I composed pastiches:</p>
<p> &#x2026;Fr&#xE4;ulen von Kulp</p>
<p> may turn, her hand upon the door;</p>
<p> I will not follow her. Nor Fresca. Nor</p>
<p> that Gull.</p>
<p> A paper of mine entitled &#x201C;The Proustian theme in a letter from Keats to</p>
<p>Benjamin Bailey&#x201D; was chuckled over by the six or seven scholars who read it.</p>
<p>I launched upon an &#x201C;Histoire abreg&#xE8;e de la po&#xE8;sie anglaise&#x201D; for a</p>
<p>prominent publishing firm, and then started to compile that manual of French</p>
<p>literature for English-speaking students (with comparisons drawn from</p>
<p>English writers) which was to occupy me throughout the forties&#x2013;and the last</p>
<p>volume of which was almost ready for press by the time of my arrest.</p>
<p> I found a job&#x2013;teaching English to a group of adults in Auteuil. Then a</p>
<p>school for boys employed me for a couple of winters. Now and then I took</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (8 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:53file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>advantage of the acquaintances I had formed among social workers and</p>
<p>psychotherapists to visit in their company various institutions, such as</p>
<p>orphanages and reform schools, where pale pubescent girls with matted</p>
<p>eyelashes could be stared at in perfect impunity remindful of that granted</p>
<p>one in dreams.</p>
<p> Now I wish to introduce the following idea. Between the age limits of</p>
<p>nine and fourteen there occur maidens who, to certain bewitched travelers,</p>
<p>twice or many times older than they, reveal their true nature which is not</p>
<p>human, but nymphic (that is, demoniac); and these chosen creatures I propose</p>
<p>to designate as &#x201C;nymphets.&#x201D;</p>
<p> It will be marked that I substitute time terms for spatial ones. In</p>
<p>fact, I would have the reader see &#x201C;nine&#x201D; and &#x201C;fourteen&#x201D; as the</p>
<p>boundaries&#x2013;the mirrory beaches and rosy rocks&#x2013;of an enchanted island</p>
<p>haunted by those nymphets of mine and surrounded by a vast, misty sea.</p>
<p>Between those age limits, are all girl-children nymphets? Of course not.</p>
<p>Otherwise, we who are in the know, we lone voyagers, we nympholepts, would</p>
<p>have long gone insane. Neither are good looks any criterion; and vulgarity,</p>
<p>or at least what a given community terms so, does not necessarily impair</p>
<p>certain mysterious characteristics, the fey grace, the elusive, shifty,</p>
<p>soul-shattering, insidious charm that separates the nymphet from such</p>
<p>coevals of hers as are incomparably more dependent on the spatial world of</p>
<p>synchronous phenomena than on that intangible island of entranced time where</p>
<p>Lolita plays with her likes. Within the same age limits the number of true</p>
<p>nymphets is trickingly inferior to that of provisionally plain, or just</p>
<p>nice, or &#x201C;cute,&#x201D; or even &#x201C;sweet&#x201D; and &#x201C;attractive,&#x201D; ordinary, plumpish,</p>
<p>formless, cold-skinned, essentially human little girls, with tummies and</p>
<p>pigtails, who may or may not turn into adults of great beauty (look at the</p>
<p>ugly dumplings in black stockings and white hats that are metamorphosed into</p>
<p>stunning stars of the screen). A normal man given a group photograph of</p>
<p>school girls or Girl Scouts and asked to point out the comeliest one will</p>
<p>not necessarily choose the nymphet among them. You have to be an artist and</p>
<p>a madman, a creature of infinite melancholy, with a bubble of hot poison in</p>
<p>your loins and a super-voluptuous flame permanently aglow in your subtle</p>
<p>spine (oh, how you have to cringe and hide!), in order to discern at once,</p>
<p>by ineffable signs&#x2013;the slightly feline outline of a cheekbone, the</p>
<p>slenderness of a downy limb, and other indices which despair and shame and</p>
<p>tears of tenderness forbid me to tabulate&#x2013;the little deadly demon among the</p>
<p>wholesome children; she stands unrecognized by them and unconscious</p>
<p>herself of her fantastic power.</p>
<p> Furthermore, since the idea of time plays such a magic part in the</p>
<p>matter, the student should not be surprised to learn that there must be a</p>
<p>gap of several years, never less than ten I should say, generally thirty or</p>
<p>forty, and as many as ninety in a few known cases, between maiden and man to</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (9 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:53file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>enable the latter to come under a nymphet&#x2019;s spell. It is a question of focal</p>
<p>adjustment, of a certain distance that the inner eye thrills to surmount,</p>
<p>and a certain contrast that the mind perceives with a gasp of perverse</p>
<p>delight. When I was a child and she was a child, my little Annabel was no</p>
<p>nymphet to me; I was her equal, a faunlet in my own right, on that same</p>
<p>enchanted island of time; but today, in September 1952, after twenty-nine</p>
<p>years have elapsed, I think I can distinguish in her the initial fateful elf</p>
<p>in my life. We loved each other with a premature love, marked by a</p>
<p>fierceness that so often destroys adult lives. I was a strong lad and</p>
<p>survived; but the poison was in the wound, and the wound remained ever open,</p>
<p>and soon I found myself maturing amid a civilization which allows a man of</p>
<p>twenty-five to court a girl of sixteen but not a girl of twelve.</p>
<p> No wonder, then, that my adult life during the European period of my</p>
<p>existence proved monstrously twofold. Overtly, I had so-called normal</p>
<p>relationships with a number of terrestrial women having pumpkins or pears</p>
<p>for breasts; inly, I was consumed by a hell furnace of localized lust for</p>
<p>every passing nymphet whom as a law-abiding poltroon I never dared approach.</p>
<p>The human females I was allowed to wield were but palliative agents. I am</p>
<p>ready to believe that the sensations I derived from natural fornication were</p>
<p>much the same as those known to normal big males consorting with their</p>
<p>normal big mates in that routine rhythm which shakes the world. The trouble</p>
<p>was that those gentlemen had not, and I had, caught glimpses of an</p>
<p>incomparably more poignant bliss. The dimmest of my pollutive dreams was a</p>
<p>thousand times more dazzling than all the adultery the most virile writer of</p>
<p>genius or the most talented impotent might imagine. My world was split. I</p>
<p>was aware of not one but two sexes, neither of which was mine; both would be</p>
<p>termed female by the anatomist. But to me, through the prism of my senses,</p>
<p>&#x201C;they were as different as mist and mast.&#x201D; All this I rationalize now. In my</p>
<p>twenties and early thirties, I did not understand my throes quite so</p>
<p>clearly. While my body knew what it craved for, my mind rejected my body&#x2019;s</p>
<p>every plea. One moment I was ashamed and frightened, another recklessly</p>
<p>optimistic. Taboos strangulated me. Psychoanalysts wooed me with</p>
<p>pseudoliberations of pseudolibidoes. The fact that to me the only object of</p>
<p>amorous tremor were sisters of Annabel&#x2019;s, her handmaids and girl-pages,</p>
<p>appeared to me at times as a forerunner of insanity. At other times I would</p>
<p>tell myself that it was all a question of attitude, that there was really</p>
<p>nothing wrong in being moved to distraction by girl-children. Let me remind</p>
<p>my reader that in England, with the passage of the Children and Young Person</p>
<p>Act in 1933, the term &#x201C;girl-child&#x201D; is defined as &#x201C;a girl who is over eight</p>
<p>but under fourteen years&#x201D; (after that, from fourteen to seventeen, the</p>
<p>statutory definition is &#x201C;young person&#x201D;). In Massachusetts, U.S., on the</p>
<p>other hand, a &#x201C;wayward child&#x201D; is, technically, one &#x201C;between seven and</p>
<p>seventeen years of age&#x201D; (who, moreover, habitually associates with vicious</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (10 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:53file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>or immoral persons). Hugh Broughton, a writer of controversy in the reign of</p>
<p>James the First, has proved that Rahab was a harlot at ten years of age.</p>
<p>This is all very interesting, and I daresay you see me already frothing at</p>
<p>the mouth in a fit; but no, I am not; I am just winking happy thoughts into</p>
<p>a little tiddle cup. Here are some more pictures. Here is Virgil who could</p>
<p>the nymphet sing in a single tone, but probably preferred a lad&#x2019;s perineum.</p>
<p>Here are two of King Akhnaten&#x2019;s and Queen Nefertiti&#x2019;s pre-nubile Nile</p>
<p>daughters (that royal couple had a litter of six), wearing nothing but many</p>
<p>necklaces of bright beads, relaxed on cushions, intact after three thousand</p>
<p>years, with their soft brown puppybodies, cropped hair and long ebony eyes.</p>
<p>Here are some brides of ten compelled to seat themselves on the fascinum,</p>
<p>the virile ivory in the temples of classical scholarship. Marriage and</p>
<p>cohabitation before the age of puberty are still not uncommon in certain</p>
<p>East Indian provinces. Lepcha old men of eighty copulate with girls of</p>
<p>eight, and nobody minds. After all, Dante fell madly in love with Beatrice</p>
<p>when she was nine, a sparkling girleen, painted and lovely, and bejeweled,</p>
<p>in a crimson frock, and this was in 1274, in Florence, at a private feast in</p>
<p>the merry month of May. And when Petrarch fell madly in love with his</p>
<p>Laureen, she was a fair-haired nymphet of twelve running in the wind, in the</p>
<p>pollen and dust, a flower in flight, in the beautiful plain as descried from</p>
<p>the hills of Vaucluse.</p>
<p> But let us be prim and civilized. Humbert Humbert tried hard to be</p>
<p>good. Really and truly, he id. He had the utmost respect for ordinary</p>
<p>children, with their purity and vulnerability, and under no circumstances</p>
<p>would he have interfered with the innocence of a child, if there was the</p>
<p>least risk of a row. But how his heart beat when, among the innocent throng,</p>
<p>he espied a demon child, &#x201C;enfant charmante et fourbe,&#x201D; dim eyes,</p>
<p>bright lips, ten years in jail if you only show her you are looking at her.</p>
<p>So life went. Humbert was perfectly capable of intercourse with Eve, but it</p>
<p>was Lilith he longed for. The bud-stage of breast development appears early</p>
<p>(10.7 years) in the sequence of somatic changes accompanying pubescence. And</p>
<p>the next maturational item available is the first appearance of pigmented</p>
<p>pubic hair (11.2 years). My little cup brims with tiddles.</p>
<p> A shipwreck. An atoll. Alone with a drowned passenger&#x2019;s shivering</p>
<p>child. Darling, this is only a game! How marvelous were my fancied</p>
<p>adventures as I sat on a hard park bench pretending to be immersed in a</p>
<p>trembling book. Around the quiet scholar, nymphets played freely, as if he</p>
<p>were a familiar statue or part of an old tree&#x2019;s shadow and sheen. Once a</p>
<p>perfect little beauty in a tartan frock, with a clatter put her heavily</p>
<p>armed foot near me upon the bench to dip her slim bare arms into me and</p>
<p>righten the strap of her roller skate, and I dissolved in the sun, with my</p>
<p>book for fig leaf, as her auburn ringlets fell all over her skinned knee,</p>
<p>and the shadow of leaves I shared pulsated and melted on her radiant limb</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (11 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:53file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>next to my chameleonic cheek. Another time a red-haired school girl hung</p>
<p>over me in the metro, and a revelation of axillary russet I obtained</p>
<p>remained in my blood for weeks. I could list a great number of these</p>
<p>one-sided diminutive romances. Some of them ended in a rich flavor of hell.</p>
<p>It happened for instance that from my balcony I would notice a lighted</p>
<p>window across the street and what looked like a nymphet in the act of</p>
<p>undressing before a co-operative mirror. Thus isolated, thus removed, the</p>
<p>vision acquired an especially keen charm that made me race with all speed</p>
<p>toward my lone gratification. But abruptly, fiendishly, the tender pattern</p>
<p>of nudity I had adored would be transformed into the disgusting lamp-lit</p>
<p>bare arm of a man in his underclothes reading his paper by the open window</p>
<p>in the hot, damp, hopeless summer night.</p>
<p> Rope-skipping, hopscotch. That old woman in black who sat down next to</p>
<p>me on my bench, on my rack of joy (a nymphet was groping under me for a lost</p>
<p>marble), and asked if I had stomachache, the insolent hag. Ah, leave me</p>
<p>alone in my pubescent park, in my mossy garden. Let them play around me</p>
<p>forever. Never grow up.</p>
<p> 6</p>
<p> A propos: I have often wondered what became of those nymphets later? In</p>
<p>this wrought-iron would of criss-cross cause and effect, could it be that</p>
<p>the hidden throb I stole from them did not affect their future? I had</p>
<p>possessed her&#x2013;and she never knew it. All right. But would it not tell</p>
<p>sometime later? Had I not somehow tampered with her fate by involving her</p>
<p>image in my voluptas? Oh, it was, and remains, a source of great and</p>
<p>terrible wonder.</p>
<p> I learned, however, what they looked like, those lovely, maddening,</p>
<p>thin-armed nymphets, when they grew up. I remember walking along an animated</p>
<p>street on a gray spring afternoon somewhere near the Madeleine. A short slim</p>
<p>girl passed me at a rapid, high-heeled, tripping step, we glanced back at</p>
<p>the same moment, she stopped and I accosted her. She came hardly up to my</p>
<p>chest hair and had the kind of dimpled round little face French girls so</p>
<p>often have, and I liked her long lashes and tight-fitting tailored dress</p>
<p>sheathing in pearl-gray her young body which still retained&#x2013;and that was</p>
<p>the nymphic echo, the chill of delight, the leap in my loins&#x2013;a childish</p>
<p>something mingling with the professional fretillement of her small</p>
<p>agile rump. I asked her price, and she promptly replied with melodious</p>
<p>silvery precision (a bird, a very bird!) &#x201C;Cent.&#x201D; I tried to haggle</p>
<p>but she saw the awful lone longing in my lowered eyes, directed so far down</p>
<p>at her round forehead and rudimentary hat (a band, a posy); and with one</p>
<p>beat of her lashes: &#x201C;Tant pis,&#x201D; she said, and made as if to move</p>

<p>away. Perhaps only three years earlier I might have seen her coming home</p>
<p>from school! That evocation settled the matter. She led me up the usual</p>
<p>steep stairs, with the usual bell clearing the way for the monsieur</p>
<p>who might not care to meet another monsieur, on the mournful climb to</p>
<p>the abject room, all bed and bidet. As usual, she asked at once for</p>
<p>her petit cadeau, and as usual I asked her name (Monique) and her age</p>
<p>(eighteen). I was pretty well acquainted with the banal way of</p>
<p>streetwalkers. They all answer &#x201C;dix-huit&#x201D;&#x2013;a trim twitter, a note of</p>
<p>finality and wistful deceit which they emit up to ten times per day, the</p>
<p>poor little creatures. But in Monique&#x2019;s case there could be no doubt she</p>
<p>was, if anything, adding one or two years to her age. This I deduced from</p>
<p>many details of her compact, neat, curiously immature body. Having shed her</p>
<p>clothes with fascinating rapidity, she stood for a moment partly wrapped in</p>
<p>the dingy gauze of the window curtain listening with infantile pleasure, as</p>
<p>pat as pat could be, to an organ-grinder in the dust-brimming courtyard</p>
<p>below. When I examined her small hands and drew her attention to their</p>
<p>grubby fingernails, she said with a naive frown &#x201C;Oui, ce n&#x2019;est pas</p>
<p>bien,&#x201D; and went to the wash-basin, but I said it did not matter, did not</p>
<p>matter at all. With her brown bobbed hair, luminous gray eyes and pale skin,</p>
<p>she looked perfectly charming. Her hips were no bigger than those of a</p>
<p>squatting lad; in fact, I do not hesitate to say (and indeed this is the</p>
<p>reason why I linger gratefully in that gauze-gray room of memory with little</p>
<p>Monique) that among the eighty or so grues I had had operate upon me,</p>
<p>she was the only one that gave me a pang of genuine pleasure. &#x201C;Il &#xE8;tait</p>
<p>malin, celui qui a invent&#xE8; ce truc-la,&#x201D; she commented amiably, and got</p>
<p>back into her clothes with the same high-style speed.</p>
<p> I asked for another, more elaborate, assignment later the same evening,</p>
<p>and she said she would meet me at the corner cafe at nine, and swore she had</p>
<p>never pose un lapin in all her young life. We returned to the same</p>
<p>room, and I could not help saying how very pretty she was to which she</p>
<p>answered demurely: &#x201C;Tu es bien gentil de dire ca&#x201D; and then, noticing</p>
<p>what I noticed too in the mirror reflecting our small Eden&#x2013;the dreadful</p>
<p>grimace of clenched-teeth tenderness that distorted my mouth&#x2013;dutiful little</p>
<p>Monique (oh, she had been a nymphet, all right!) wanted to know if she</p>
<p>should remove the layer of red from her lips avant qu&#x2019;on se couche in</p>
<p>case I planned to kiss her. Of course, I planned it. I let myself go with</p>
<p>her more completely than I had with any young lady before, and my last</p>
<p>vision that night of long-lashed Monique is touched up with a gaiety that I</p>
<p>find seldom associated with any event in my humiliating, sordid, taciturn</p>
<p>love life. She looked tremendously pleased with the bonus of fifty I gave</p>
<p>her as she trotted out into the April night drizzle with Humbert Humbert</p>
<p>lumbering in her narrow wake. Stopping before a window display she said with</p>
<p>great gusto: &#x201C;Je vais m&#x2019;acheter des bas!&#x201D; and never may I forget the</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (13 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:53file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>way her Parisian childish lips exploded on &#x201C;bas,&#x201D; pronouncing it with</p>
<p>an appetite that all but changed the &#x201C;a&#x201D; into a brief buoyant bursting &#x201C;o&#x201D;</p>
<p>as in &#x201C;bot&#x201D;.</p>
<p> I had a date with her next day at 2.15 P.M. in my own rooms, but it was</p>
<p>less successful, she seemed to have grown less juvenile, more of a woman</p>
<p>overnight. A cold I caught from her led me to cancel a fourth assignment,</p>
<p>nor was I sorry to break an emotional series that threatened to burden me</p>
<p>with heart-rending fantasies and peter out in dull disappointment. So let</p>
<p>her remain, sleek, slender Monique, as she was for a minute or two: a</p>
<p>delinquent nymphet shining through the matter-of-fact young whore.</p>
<p> My brief acquaintance with her started a train of thought that may seem</p>
<p>pretty obvious to the reader who knows the ropes. An advertisement in a lewd</p>
<p>magazine landed me, one brave day, in the office of a Mlle Edith who began</p>
<p>by offering me to choose a kindred soul from a collection of rather formal</p>
<p>photographs in a rather soiled album (&#x201C;Regardez-moi cette belle</p>
<p>brune!&#x201D;. When I pushed the album away and somehow managed to blurt out</p>
<p>my criminal craving, she looked as if about to show me the door; however,</p>
<p>after asking me what price I was prepared to disburse, she condescended to</p>
<p>put me in touch with a person qui pourrait arranger la chose. Next</p>
<p>day, an asthmatic woman, coarsely painted, garrulous, garlicky, with an</p>
<p>almost farcical Proven&#xE3;al accent and a black mustache above a purple lip,</p>
<p>took me to what was apparently her own domicile, and there, after</p>
<p>explosively kissing the bunched tips of her fat fingers to signify the</p>
<p>delectable rosebud quality of her merchandise, she theatrically drew aside a</p>
<p>curtain to reveal what I judged was that part of the room where a large and</p>
<p>unfastidious family usually slept. It was now empty save for a monstrously</p>
<p>plump, sallow, repulsively plain girl of at least fifteen with red-ribboned</p>
<p>thick black braids who sat on a chair perfunctorily nursing a bald doll.</p>
<p>When I shook my head and tried to shuffle out of the trap, the woman,</p>
<p>talking fast, began removing the dingy woolen jersey from the young</p>
<p>giantess&#x2019; torso; then, seeing my determination to leave, she demanded son</p>
<p>argent. A door at the end of the room was opened, and two men who had</p>
<p>been dining in the kitchen joined in the squabble. They were misshapen,</p>
<p>bare-necked, very swarthy and one of them wore dark glasses. A small boy and</p>
<p>a begrimed, bowlegged toddler lurked behind them. With the insolent logic of</p>
<p>a nightmare, the enraged procuress, indicating the man in glasses, said he</p>
<p>had served in the police, lui, so that I had better do as I was told.</p>
<p>I went up to Marie&#x2013;for that was her stellar name&#x2013;who by then had quietly</p>
<p>transferred her heavy haunches to a stool at the kitchen table and resumed</p>
<p>her interrupted soup while the toddler picked up the doll. With a surge of</p>
<p>pity dramatizing my idiotic gesture, I thrust a banknote into her</p>
<p>indifferent hand. She surrendered my gift to the ex-detective, whereupon I</p>
<p>was suffered to leave.</p>

<p> 7</p>
<p> I do not know if the pimp&#x2019;s album may not have been another link in</p>
<p>the daisy-chain; but soon after, for my own safety, I decided to marry. It</p>
<p>occurred to me that regular hours, home-cooked meals, all the conventions of</p>
<p>marriage, the prophylactic routine of its bedroom activities and, who knows,</p>
<p>the eventual flowering of certain moral values, of certain spiritual</p>
<p>substitutes, might help me, if not to purge myself of my degrading and</p>
<p>dangerous desires, at least to keep them under pacific control. A little</p>
<p>money that had come my way after my father&#x2019;s death (nothing very grand&#x2013;the</p>
<p>Mirana had been sold long before), in addition to my striking if somewhat</p>
<p>brutal good looks, allowed me to enter upon my quest with equanimity. After</p>
<p>considerable deliberation, my choice fell on the daughter of a Polish</p>
<p>doctor: the good man happened to be treating me for spells of dizziness and</p>
<p>tachycardia. We played chess; his daughter watched me from behind her easel,</p>
<p>and inserted eyes or knuckles borrowed from me into the cubistic trash that</p>
<p>accomplished misses then painted instead of lilacs and lambs. Let me repeat</p>
<p>with quiet force: I was, and still am, despite mes malheurs, an</p>
<p>exceptionally handsome male; slow-moving, tall, with soft dark hair and a</p>
<p>gloomy but all the more seductive cast of demeanor. Exceptional virility</p>
<p>often reflects in the subject&#x2019;s displayable features a sullen and congested</p>
<p>something that pertains to what he has to conceal. And this was my case.</p>
<p>Well did I know, alas, that I could obtain at the snap of my fingers any</p>
<p>adult female I chose; in fact, it had become quite a habit with me of not</p>
<p>being too attentive to women lest they come toppling, bloodripe, into my</p>
<p>cold lap. Had I been a fran&#xE3;ais moyen with a taste for flashy ladies,</p>
<p>I might have easily found, among the many crazed beauties that lashed my</p>
<p>grim rock, creatures far more fascinating than Valeria. My choice, however,</p>
<p>was prompted by considerations whose essence was, as I realized too late, a</p>
<p>piteous compromise. All of which goes to show how dreadfully stupid poor</p>
<p>Humbert always was in matters of sex.</p>
<p> 8</p>
<p> Although I told myself I was looking merely for a soothing presence, a</p>
<p>glorified pot-au-feu, an animated merkin, what really attracted me to</p>
<p>Valeria was the imitation she gave of a little girl. She gave it not because</p>
<p>she had divined something about me; it was just her style&#x2013;and I fell for</p>
<p>it. Actually, she was at least in her late twenties (I never established her</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (15 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:53file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>exact age for even her passport lied) and had mislaid her virginity under</p>
<p>circumstances that changed with her reminiscent moods. I, on my part, was as</p>
<p>naive as only a pervert can be. She looked fluffy and frolicsome, dressed</p>
<p>a la gamine, showed a generous amount of smooth leg, knew how to</p>
<p>stress the white of a bare instep by the black of a velvet slipper, and</p>
<p>pouted, and dimpled, and romped, and dirndled, and shook her short curly</p>
<p>blond hair in the cutest and tritest fashion imaginable.</p>
<p> After a brief ceremony at the mairie, I tool her to the new</p>
<p>apartment I had rented and, somewhat to her surprise, had her wear, before I</p>
<p>touched her, a girl&#x2019;s plain nightshirt that I had managed to filch from the</p>
<p>linen closet of an orphanage. I derived some fun from that nuptial night and</p>
<p>had the idiot in hysterics by sunrise. But reality soon asserted itself. The</p>
<p>bleached curl revealed its melanic root; the down turned to prickles on a</p>
<p>shaved shin; the mobile moist mouth, no matter how I stuffed it with love,</p>
<p>disclosed ignominiously its resemblance to the corresponding part in a</p>
<p>treasured portrait of her toadlike dead mama; and presently, instead of a</p>
<p>pale little gutter girl, Humbert Humbert had on his hands a large, puffy,</p>
<p>short-legged, big-breasted and practically brainless baba.</p>
<p> This state of affairs lasted from 1935 to 1939. Her only asset was a</p>
<p>muted nature which did help to produce an odd sense of comfort in our small</p>
<p>squalid flat: two rooms, a hazy view in one window, a brick wall in the</p>
<p>other, a tiny kitchen, a shoe-shaped bath tub, within which I felt like</p>
<p>Marat but with no white-necked maiden to stab me. We had quite a few cozy</p>
<p>evenings together, she deep in her Paris-Soir, I working at a rickety</p>
<p>table. We went to movies, bicycle races and boxing matches. I appealed to</p>
<p>her stale flesh very seldom, only in cases of great urgency and despair. The</p>
<p>grocer opposite had a little daughter whose shadow drove me mad; but with</p>
<p>Valeria&#x2019;s help I did find after all some legal outlets to my fantastic</p>
<p>predicament. As to cooking, we tacitly dismissed the pot-au-feu and</p>
<p>had most of our meals at a crowded place in rue Bonaparte where there were</p>
<p>wine stains on the table cloth and a good deal of foreign babble. And next</p>
<p>door, an art dealer displayed in his cluttered window a splendid,</p>
<p>flamboyant, green, red, golden and inky blue, ancient American estampe&#x2013;a</p>
<p>locomotive with a gigantic smokestack, great baroque lamps and a tremendous</p>
<p>cowcatcher, hauling its mauve coaches through the stormy prairie night and</p>
<p>mixing a lot of spark-studded black smoke with the furry thunder clouds.</p>
<p> These burst. In the summer of 1939 mon oncle d&#x2019;Am&#xE8;rique died</p>
<p>bequeathing me an annual income of a few thousand dollars on condition I</p>
<p>came to live in the States and showed some interest in his business. This</p>
<p>prospect was most welcome to me. I felt my life needed a shake-up. There was</p>
<p>another thing, too: moth holes had appeared in the plush of matrimonial</p>
<p>comfort. During the last weeks I had kept noticing that my fat Valeria was</p>
<p>not her usual self; had acquired a queer restlessness; even showed something</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (16 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:53file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>like irritation at times, which was quite out of keeping with the stock</p>
<p>character she was supposed to impersonate. When I informed her we were</p>
<p>shortly to sail for New York, she looked distressed and bewildered. There</p>
<p>were some tedious difficulties with her papers. She had a Nansen, or better</p>
<p>say Nonsense, passport which for some reason a share in her husband&#x2019;s solid</p>
<p>Swiss citizenship could not easily transcend; and I decided it was the</p>
<p>necessity of queuing in the pr&#xE8;fecture, and other formalities, that</p>
<p>had made her so listless, despite my patiently describing to her America,</p>
<p>the country of rosy children and great trees, where life would be such an</p>
<p>improvement on dull dingy Paris.</p>
<p> We were coming out of some office building one morning, with her papers</p>
<p>almost in order, when Valeria, as she waddled by my side, began to shake her</p>
<p>poodle head vigorously without saying a word. I let her go on for a while</p>
<p>and then asked if she thought she had something inside. She answered (I</p>
<p>translate from her French which was, I imagine, a translation in its turn of</p>
<p>some Slavic platitude): &#x201C;There is another man in my life.&#x201D;</p>
<p> Now, these are ugly words for a husband to hear. They dazed me, I</p>
<p>confess. To beat her up in the street, there and then, as an honest</p>
<p>vulgarian might have done, was not feasible. Years of secret sufferings had</p>
<p>taught me superhuman self-control. So I ushered her into a taxi which had</p>
<p>been invitingly creeping along the curb for some time, and in this</p>
<p>comparative privacy I quietly suggested she comment her wild talk. A</p>
<p>mounting fury was suffocating me&#x2013;not because I had any particular fondness</p>
<p>for that figure of fun, Mme Humbert, but because matters of legal and</p>
<p>illegal conjunction were for me alone to decide, and here she was, Valeria,</p>
<p>the comedy wife, brazenly preparing to dispose in her own way of my comfort</p>
<p>and fate. I demanded her lover&#x2019;s name. I repeated my question; but she kept</p>
<p>up a burlesque babble, discoursing on her unhappiness with me and announcing</p>
<p>plans for an immediate divorce. &#x201C;Mais qui est-ce?&#x201D; I shouted at last,</p>
<p>striking her on the knee with my fist; and she, without even wincing, stared</p>
<p>at me as if the answer were too simple for words, then gave a quick shrug</p>
<p>and pointed at the thick neck of the taxi driver. He pulled up at a small</p>
<p>caf&#xE8; and introduced himself. I do not remember his ridiculous name but after</p>
<p>all those years I still see him quite clearly&#x2013;a stocky White Russian</p>
<p>ex-colonel with a bushy mustache and a crew cut; there were thousands of</p>
<p>them plying that fool&#x2019;s trade in Paris. We sat down at a table; the Tsarist</p>
<p>ordered wine, and Valeria, after applying a wet napkin to her knee, went on</p>
<p>talking&#x2013;into me rather than to me; she poured words into this</p>
<p>dignified receptacle with a volubility I had never suspected she had in her.</p>
<p>And every now and then she would volley a burst of Slavic at her stolid</p>
<p>lover. The situation was preposterous and became even more so when the</p>
<p>taxi-colonel, stopping Valeria with a possessive smile, began to unfold</p>
<p>his views and plans. With an atrocious accent to his careful French,</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (17 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:53file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>he delineated the world of love and work into which he proposed to enter</p>
<p>hand in hand with his child-wife Valeria. She by now was preening herself,</p>
<p>between him and me, rouging her pursed lips, tripling her chin to pick at</p>
<p>her blouse-bosom and so forth, and he spoke of her as if she were absent,</p>
<p>and also as if she were a kind of little ward that was in the act of being</p>
<p>transferred, for her own good, from one wise guardian to another even wiser</p>
<p>one; and although my helpless wrath may have exaggerated and disfigured</p>
<p>certain impressions, I can swear that he actually consulted me on such</p>
<p>things as her diet, her periods, her wardrobe and the books she had read or</p>
<p>should read. &#x201C;I think,&#x201D; - he said, &#x201C;She will like Jean Christophe?&#x201D;</p>
<p>Oh, he was quite a scholar, Mr. Taxovich.</p>
<p> I put an end to this gibberish by suggesting Valeria pack up her few</p>
<p>belongings immediately, upon which the platitudinous colonel gallantly</p>
<p>offered to carry them into the car. Reverting to his professional state, he</p>
<p>drove the Humberts to their residence and all the way Valeria talked, and</p>
<p>Humbert the Terrible deliberated with Humbert the Small whether Humbert</p>
<p>Humbert should kill her or her lover, or both, or neither. I remember once</p>
<p>handling an automatic belonging to a fellow student, in the days (I have not</p>
<p>spoken of them, I think, but never mind) when I toyed with the idea of</p>
<p>enjoying his little sister, a most diaphanous nymphet with a black hair bow,</p>
<p>and then shooting myself. I now wondered if Valechka (as the colonel called</p>
<p>her) was really worth shooting, or strangling, or drowning. She had very</p>
<p>vulnerable legs, and I decided I would limit myself to hurting her very</p>
<p>horribly as soon as we were alone.</p>
<p> But we never were. Valechka&#x2013;by now shedding torrents of tears tinged</p>
<p>with the mess of her rainbow make-up,&#x2013;started to fill anyhow a trunk, and</p>
<p>two suitcases, and a bursting carton, and visions of putting on my mountain</p>
<p>boots and taking a running kick at her rump were of course impossible to put</p>
<p>into execution with the cursed colonel hovering around all the time. I</p>
<p>cannot say he behaved insolently or anything like that; on the contrary, he</p>
<p>displayed, as a small sideshow in the theatricals I had been inveigled in, a</p>
<p>discreet old-world civility, punctuating his movements with all sorts of</p>
<p>mispronounced apologies (j&#x2019;ai demande pardonne&#x2013;excuse me&#x2013;est-ce</p>
<p>que j&#x2019;ai puis&#x2013;may I&#x2013;and so forth), and turning away tactfully when</p>
<p>Valechka took down with a flourish her pink panties from the clothesline</p>
<p>above the tub; but he seemed to be all over the place at once, le</p>
<p>gredin, agreeing his frame with the anatomy of the flat, reading in my</p>
<p>chair my newspaper, untying a knotted string, rolling a cigarette, counting</p>
<p>the teaspoons, visiting the bathroom, helping his moll to wrap up the</p>
<p>electric fan her father had given her, and carrying streetward her luggage.</p>
<p>I sat with arms folded, one hip on the window sill, dying of hate and</p>
<p>boredom. At last both were out of the quivering apartment&#x2013;the vibration of</p>
<p>the door I had slammed after them still rang in my every nerve, a poor</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (18 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:53file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>substitute for the backhand slap with which I ought to have hit her across</p>
<p>the cheekbone according to the rules of the movies. Clumsily playing my</p>
<p>part, I stomped to the bathroom to check if they had taken my English toilet</p>
<p>water; they had not; but I noticed with a spasm of fierce disgust that the</p>
<p>former Counselor of the Tsar, after thoroughly easing his bladder, had not</p>
<p>flushed the toilet. That solemn pool of alien urine with a soggy, tawny</p>
<p>cigarette butt disintegrating in it struck me as a crowning insult, and I</p>
<p>wildly looked around for a weapon. Actually I daresay it was nothing but</p>
<p>middle-class Russian courtesy (with an oriental tang, perhaps) that had</p>
<p>prompted the good colonel (Maximovich! his name suddenly taxies back to me),</p>
<p>a very formal person as they all are, to muffle his private need in decorous</p>
<p>silence so as not to underscore the small size of his host&#x2019;s domicile with</p>
<p>the rush of a gross cascade on top of his own hushed trickle. But this did</p>
<p>not enter my mind at the moment, as groaning with rage I ransacked the</p>
<p>kitchen for something better than a broom. Then, canceling my search, I</p>
<p>dashed out of the house with the heroic decision of attacking him</p>
<p>barefisted; despite my natural vigor, I am no pugilist, while the short but</p>
<p>broad-shouldered Maximovich seemed made of pig iron. The void of the street,</p>
<p>revealing nothing of my wife&#x2019;s departure except a rhinestone button that she</p>
<p>had dropped in the mud after preserving it for three unnecessary years in a</p>
<p>broken box, may have spared me a bloody nose. But no matter. I had my little</p>
<p>revenge in due time. A man from Pasadena told me one day that Mrs.</p>
<p>Maximovich n&#xE8;e Zborovski had died in childbirth around 1945; the couple had</p>
<p>somehow got over to California and had been used there, for an excellent</p>
<p>salary, in a year-long experiment conducted by a distinguished American</p>
<p>ethnologist. The experiment dealt with human and racial reactions to a diet</p>
<p>of bananas and dates in a constant position on all fours. My informant, a</p>
<p>doctor, swore he had seen with his own eyes obese Valechka and her colonel,</p>
<p>by then gray-haired and also quite corpulent, diligently crawling about the</p>
<p>well-swept floors of a brightly lit set of rooms (fruit in one, water in</p>
<p>another, mats in a third and so on) in the company of several other hired</p>
<p>quadrupeds, selected from indigent and helpless groups. I tried to find the</p>
<p>results of these tests in the Review of Anthropology; but they appear</p>
<p>not to have been published yet. These scientific products take of course</p>
<p>some time to fructuate. I hope they will be illustrated with photographs</p>
<p>when they do get printed, although it is not very likely that a prison</p>
<p>library will harbor such erudite works. The one to which I am restricted</p>
<p>these days, despite my lawyer&#x2019;s favors, is a good example of the inane</p>
<p>eclecticism governing the selection of books in prison libraries. They have</p>
<p>the Bible, of course, and Dickens (an ancient set, N.Y., G.W. Dillingham,</p>
<p>Publisher, MDCCCLXXXVII); and the Children&#x2019;s Encyclopedia (with some</p>
<p>nice photographs of sunshine-haired Girl Scouts in shorts), and A Murder</p>
<p>Is Announced by Agatha Christie; but they also have such coruscating</p>

<p>trifles as A vagabond in Italy by Percy Elphinstone, author of</p>
<p>Venice Revisited, Boston, 1868, and a comparatively recent (1946)</p>
<p>Who&#x2019;s Who in the Limelight&#x2013;actors, producers, playwrights, and shots</p>
<p>of static scenes. In looking through the latter volume, I was treated last</p>
<p>night to one of those dazzling coincidences that logicians loathe and poets</p>
<p>love. I transcribe most of the page:</p>
<p> Pym, Roland. Born in Lundy, Mass., 1922. Received stage training at</p>
<p>Elsinore Playhouse, Derby, N.Y. Made debut in Sunburst. Among his</p>
<p>many appearances are Two Blocks from Here, The Girl in Green, Scrambled</p>
<p>Husbands, The Strange Mushroom, Touch and Go, John Lovely, I Was Dreaming of</p>
<p>You.</p>
<p> Quilty, Clare, American dramatist. Born in Ocean City, N.J., 1911.</p>
<p>Educated at Columbia University. Started on a commercial career but turned</p>
<p>to playwriting. Author of The Little Nymph, The Lady Who Loved</p>
<p>Lightning (in collaboration with Vivian Darkbloom), Dark Age, The</p>
<p>strange Mushroom, Fatherly Love, and others. His many plays for children</p>
<p>are notable. Little Nymph (1940) traveled 14,000 miles and played 280</p>
<p>performances on the road during the winter before ending in New York.</p>
<p>Hobbies: fast cars, photography, pets.</p>
<p> Quine, Dolores. Born in 1882, in Dayton, Ohio. Studied for stage at</p>
<p>American Academy. First played in Ottawa in 1900. Made New York debut in</p>
<p>1904 in Never Talk to Strangers. Has disappeared since in [a list of</p>
<p>some thirty plays follows].</p>
<p> How the look of my dear love&#x2019;s name even affixed to some old hag of an</p>
<p>actress, still makes me rock with helpless pain! Perhaps, she might have</p>
<p>been an actress too. Born 1935. Appeared (I notice the slip of my pen in the</p>
<p>preceding paragraph, but please do not correct it, Clarence) in The</p>
<p>Murdered Playwright. Quine the Swine. Guilty of killing Quilty. Oh, my</p>
<p>Lolita, I have only words to play with!</p>
<p> 9</p>
<p> Divorce proceedings delayed my voyage, and the gloom of yet another</p>
<p>World War had settled upon the globe when, after a winter of ennui and</p>
<p>pneumonia in Portugal, I at last reached the States. In New York I eagerly</p>
<p>accepted the soft job fate offered me: it consisted mainly of thinking up</p>
<p>and editing perfume ads. I welcomed its desultory character and</p>
<p>pseudoliterary aspects, attending to it whenever I had nothing better to do.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I was urged by a war-time university in New York to</p>
<p>complete my comparative history of French literature for English-speaking</p>

<p>students. The first volume took me a couple of years during which I put in</p>
<p>seldom less than fifteen hours of work daily. As I look back on those days,</p>
<p>I see them divided tidily into ample light and narrow shade: the light</p>
<p>pertaining to the solace of research in palatial libraries, the shade to my</p>
<p>excruciating desires and insomnias of which enough has been said. Knowing me</p>
<p>by now, the reader can easily imagine how dusty and hot I got, trying to</p>
<p>catch a glimpse of nymphets (alas, always remote) playing in Central Park,</p>
<p>and how repulsed I was by the glitter of deodorized career girls that a gay</p>
<p>dog in one of the offices kept unloading upon me. Let us skip all that. A</p>
<p>dreadful breakdown sent me to a sanatorium for more than a year; I went back</p>
<p>to my work&#x2013;only to be hospitalized again.</p>
<p> Robust outdoor life seemed to promise me some relief. One of my</p>
<p>favorite doctors, a charming cynical chap with a little brown beard, had a</p>
<p>brother, and this brother was about to lead an expedition into arctic</p>
<p>Canada. I was attached to it as a &#x201C;recorder of psychic reactions.&#x201D; With two</p>
<p>young botanists and an old carpenter I shared now and then (never very</p>
<p>successfully) the favors of one of our nutritionists, a Dr. Anita</p>
<p>Johnson&#x2013;who was soon flown back, I am glad to say. I had little notion of</p>
<p>what object the expedition was pursuing. Judging by the number of</p>
<p>meteorologists upon it, we may have been tracking to its lair (somewhere on</p>
<p>Prince of Wales&#x2019; Island, I understand) the wandering and wobbly north</p>
<p>magnetic pole. One group, jointly with the Canadians, established a weather</p>
<p>station on Pierre Point in Melville Sound. Another group, equally misguided,</p>
<p>collected plankton. A third studied tuberculosis in the tundra. Bert, a film</p>
<p>photographer&#x2013;an insecure fellow with whom at one time I was made to partake</p>
<p>in a good deal of menial work (he, too, had some psychic</p>
<p>troubles)&#x2013;maintained that the big men on our team, the real leaders we</p>
<p>never saw, were mainly engaged in checking the influence of climatic</p>
<p>amelioration on the coats of the arctic fox.</p>
<p> We lived in prefabricated timber cabins amid a Pre-Cambrian world of</p>
<p>granite. We had heaps of supplies&#x2013;the Reader&#x2019;s Digest, an ice cream</p>
<p>mixer, chemical toilets, paper caps for Christmas. My health improved</p>
<p>wonderfully in spite or because of all the fantastic blankness and boredom.</p>
<p>Surrounded by such dejected vegetation as willow scrub and lichens;</p>
<p>permeated, and, I suppose, cleansed by a whistling gale; seated on a boulder</p>
<p>under a completely translucent sky (through which, however, nothing of</p>
<p>importance showed), I felt curiously aloof from my own self. No temptations</p>
<p>maddened me. The plump, glossy little Eskimo girls with their fish smell,</p>
<p>hideous raven hair and guinea pig faces, evoked even less desire in me than</p>
<p>Dr. Johnson had. Nymphets do not occur in polar regions.</p>
<p> I left my betters the task of analyzing glacial drifts, drumlins, and</p>
<p>gremlins, and kremlins, and for a time tried to jot down what I fondly</p>
<p>thought were &#x201C;reactions&#x201D; (I noticed, for instance, that dreams under the</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (21 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:53file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>midnight sun tended to be highly colored, and this my friend the</p>
<p>photographer confirmed). I was also supposed to quiz my various companions</p>
<p>on a number of important matters, such as nostalgia, fear of unknown</p>
<p>animals, food-fantasies, nocturnal emissions, hobbies, choice of radio</p>
<p>programs, changes in outlook and so forth. Everybody got so fed up with this</p>
<p>that I soon dropped the project completely, and only toward the end of my</p>
<p>twenty months of cold labor (as one of the botanists jocosely put it)</p>
<p>concocted a perfectly spurious and very racy report that the reader will</p>
<p>find published in he Annals of Adult Psychophysics for 1945 or 1946,</p>
<p>as well as in the issue of Arctic Explorations devoted to that</p>
<p>particular expedition; which, in conclusion, was not really concerned with</p>
<p>Victoria Island copper or anything like that, as I learned later from my</p>
<p>genial doctor; for the nature of its real purpose was what is termed</p>
<p>&#x201C;hush-hush,&#x201D; and so let me add merely that whatever it was, that purpose was</p>
<p>admirably achieved.</p>
<p> The reader will regret to learn that soon after my return to</p>
<p>civilization I had another bout with insanity (if to melancholia and a sense</p>
<p>of insufferable oppression that cruel term must be applied). I owe my</p>
<p>complete restoration to a discovery I made while being treated at that</p>
<p>particular very expensive sanatorium. I discovered there was an endless</p>
<p>source of robust enjoyment in trifling with psychiatrists: cunningly leading</p>
<p>them on; never letting them see that you know all the tricks of the trade;</p>
<p>inventing for them elaborate dreams, pure classics in style (which make</p>
<p>them, the dream-extortionists, dream and wake up shrieking); teasing</p>
<p>them with fake &#x201C;primal scenes&#x201D;; and never allowing them the slightest</p>
<p>glimpse of one&#x2019;s real sexual predicament. By bribing a nurse I won access to</p>
<p>some files and discovered, with glee, cards calling me &#x201C;potentially</p>
<p>homosexual&#x201D; and &#x201C;totally impotent.&#x201D; The sport was so excellent, its</p>
<p>results&#x2013;in my case&#x2013;so ruddy that I stayed on for a whole month</p>
<p>after I was quite well (sleeping admirably and eating like a schoolgirl).</p>
<p>And then I added another week just for the pleasure of taking on a powerful</p>
<p>newcomer, a displaced (and, surely, deranged) celebrity, known for his knack</p>
<p>of making patients believe they had witnessed their own conception.</p>
<p> 10</p>
<p> Upon signing out, I cast around for some place in the New England</p>
<p>countryside or sleepy small town (elms, white church) where I could spend a</p>
<p>studious summer subsisting on a compact boxful of notes I had accumulated</p>
<p>and bathing in some nearby lake. My work had begun to interest me again&#x2013;I</p>
<p>mean my scholarly exertions; the other thing, my active participation in my</p>
<p>uncle&#x2019;s posthumous perfumes, had by then been cut down to a minimum.</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (22 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:53file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p> One of his former employees, the scion of a distinguished family,</p>
<p>suggested I spend a few months in the residence of his impoverished cousins,</p>
<p>a Mr. McCoo, retired, and his wife, who wanted to let their upper story</p>
<p>where a late aunt had delicately dwelt. He said they had two little</p>
<p>daughters, one a baby, the other a girl of twelve, and a beautiful garden,</p>
<p>not far from a beautiful lake, and I said it sounded perfectly perfect.</p>
<p> I exchanged letters with these people, satisfying them I was</p>
<p>housebroken, and spent a fantastic night on the train, imagining in all</p>
<p>possible detail the enigmatic nymphet I would coach in French and fondle in</p>
<p>Humbertish. Nobody met me at the toy station where I alighted with my new</p>
<p>expensive bag, and nobody answered the telephone; eventually, however, a</p>
<p>distraught McCoo in wet clothes turned up at the only hotel of</p>
<p>green-and-pink Ramsdale with the news that his house had just burned</p>
<p>down&#x2013;possibly, owing to the synchronous conflagration that had been raging</p>
<p>all night in my veins. His family, he said, had fled to a farm he owned, and</p>
<p>had taken the car, but a friend of his wife&#x2019;s, a grand person, Mrs. Haze of</p>
<p>342 Lawn Street, offered to accommodate me. A lady who lived opposite Mrs.</p>
<p>Haze&#x2019;s had lent McCoo her limousine, a marvelously old-fashioned,</p>
<p>square-topped affair, manned by a cheerful Negro. Now, since the only reason</p>
<p>for my coming at all had vanished, the aforesaid arrangement seemed</p>
<p>preposterous. All right, his house would have to be completely rebuilt, so</p>
<p>what? Had he not insured it sufficiently? I was angry, disappointed and</p>
<p>bored, but being a polite European, could not refuse to be sent off to Lawn</p>
<p>Street in that funeral car, feeling that otherwise McCoo would devise an</p>
<p>even more elaborate means of getting rid of me. I saw him scamper away, and</p>
<p>my chauffeur shook his head with a soft chuckle. En route, I swore to myself</p>
<p>I would not dream of staying in Ramsdale under any circumstance but would</p>
<p>fly that very day to the Bermudas or the Bahamas or the Blazes.</p>
<p>Possibilities of sweetness on technicolor beaches had been trickling through</p>
<p>my spine for some time before, and McCoo&#x2019;s cousin had, in fact, sharply</p>
<p>diverted that train of thought with his well-meaning but as it transpired</p>
<p>now absolutely inane suggestion.</p>
<p> Speaking of sharp turns: we almost ran over a meddlesome suburban dog</p>
<p>(one of those who like in wait for cars) as we swerved into Lawn Street. A</p>
<p>little further, the Haze house, a white-frame horror, appeared, looking</p>
<p>dingy and old, more gray than white&#x2013;the kind of place you know will have a</p>
<p>rubber tube affixable to the tub faucet in lieu of shower. I tipped the</p>
<p>chauffeur and hoped he would immediately drive away so that I might double</p>
<p>back unnoticed to my hotel and bag; but the man merely crossed to the other</p>
<p>side of the street where an old lady was calling to him from her porch. What</p>
<p>could I do? I pressed the bell button.</p>
<p> A colored maid let me in&#x2013;and left me standing on the mat while she</p>
<p>rushed back to the kitchen where something was burning that ought not to</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (23 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:53file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>burn.</p>
<p> The front hall was graced with door chimes, a white-eyed wooden</p>
<p>thingamabob of commercial Mexican origin, and that banal darling of the arty</p>
<p>middle class, van Gogh&#x2019;s &#x201C;Arl&#xE8;sienne.&#x201D; A door ajar to the right afforded a</p>
<p>glimpse of a living room, with some more Mexican trash in a corner cabinet</p>
<p>and a striped sofa along the wall. There was a staircase at the end of the</p>
<p>hallway, and as I stood mopping my brow (only now did I realize how hot it</p>
<p>had been out-of-doors) and staring, to stare at something, at an old gray</p>
<p>tennis ball that lay on an oak chest, there came from the upper landing the</p>
<p>contralto voice of Mrs. Haze, who leaning over the banisters inquired</p>
<p>melodiously, &#x201C;Is that Monsieur Humbert?&#x201D; A bit of cigarette ash dropped from</p>
<p>there in addition. Presently, the lady herself&#x2013;sandals, maroon slacks,</p>
<p>yellow silk blouse, squarish face, in that order&#x2013;came down the steps, her</p>
<p>index finger still tapping upon her cigarette.</p>
<p> I think I had better describe her right away, to get it over with. The</p>
<p>poor lady was in her middle thirties, she had a shiny forehead, plucked</p>
<p>eyebrows and quite simple but not unattractive features of a type that may</p>
<p>be defined as a weak solution of Marlene Dietrich. Patting her bronze-brown</p>
<p>bun, she led me into the parlor and we talked for a minute about the McCoo</p>
<p>fire and the privilege of living in Ramsdale. Her very wide-set sea-green</p>
<p>eyes had a funny way of traveling all over you, carefully avoiding your own</p>
<p>eyes. Her smile was but a quizzical jerk of one eyebrow; and uncoiling</p>
<p>herself from the sofa as she talked, she kept making spasmodic dashes at</p>
<p>three ashtrays and the near fender (where lay the brown core of an apple);</p>
<p>whereupon she would sink back again, one leg folded under her. She was,</p>
<p>obviously, one of those women whose polished words may reflect a book club</p>
<p>or bridge club, or any other deadly conventionality, but never her soul;</p>
<p>women who are completely devoid of humor; women utterly indifferent at heart</p>
<p>to the dozen or so possible subjects of a parlor conversation, but very</p>
<p>particular about the rules of such conversations, through the sunny</p>
<p>cellophane of which not very appetizing frustrations can be readily</p>
<p>distinguished. I was perfectly aware that if by any wild chance I became her</p>
<p>lodger, she would methodically proceed to do in regard to me what taking a</p>
<p>lodger probably meant to her all along, and I would again be enmeshed in one</p>
<p>of those tedious affairs I knew so well.</p>
<p> But there was no question of my settling there. I could not be happy in</p>
<p>that type of household with bedraggled magazines on every chair and a kind</p>
<p>of horrible hybridization between the comedy of so-called &#x201C;functional modern</p>
<p>furniture&#x201D; and the tragedy of decrepit rockers and rickety lamp tables with</p>
<p>dead lamps. I was led upstairs, and to the left&#x2013;into &#x201C;my&#x201D; room. I inspected</p>
<p>it through the mist of my utter rejection of it; but I did discern above</p>
<p>&#x201C;my&#x201D; bed Ren&#xE8; Prinet&#x2019;s &#x201C;Kreutzer Sonata.&#x201D; And she called that servant maid&#x2019;s</p>
<p>room a &#x201C;semi-studio&#x201D;! Let&#x2019;s get out of here at once, I firmly said to myself</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (24 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:53file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>as I pretended to deliberate over the absurdly, and ominously, low price</p>
<p>that my wistful hostess was asking for board and bed.</p>
<p> Old-world politeness, however, obliged me to go on with the ordeal. We</p>
<p>crossed the landing to the right side of the house (where &#x201C;I and Lo have our</p>
<p>rooms&#x201D;&#x2013;Lo being presumably the maid), and the lodger-lover could hardly</p>
<p>conceal a shudder when he, a very fastidious male, was granted a preview of</p>
<p>the only bathroom, a tiny oblong between the landing and &#x201C;Lo&#x2019;s&#x201D; room, with</p>
<p>limp wet things overhanging the dubious tub (the question mark of a hair</p>
<p>inside); and there were the expected coils of the rubber snake, and its</p>
<p>complement&#x2013;a pinkish cozy, coyly covering the toilet lid.</p>
<p> &#x201C;I see you are not too favorably impressed,&#x201D; said the lady letting her</p>
<p>hand rest for a moment upon my sleeve: she combined a cool forwardness&#x2013;the</p>
<p>overflow of what I think is called &#x201C;poise&#x201D;&#x2013;with a shyness and sadness that</p>
<p>caused her detached way of selecting her words to seem as unnatural as the</p>
<p>intonation of a professor of &#x201C;speech.&#x201D; &#x201C;This is not a neat household, I</p>
<p>confess,&#x201D; the doomed ear continued, &#x201C;but I assure you [she looked at my</p>
<p>lips], you will be very comfortable, very comfortable, indeed. Let me show</p>
<p>you the garden&#x201D; (the last more brightly, with a kind of winsome toss of the</p>
<p>voice).</p>
<p> Reluctantly I followed her downstairs again; then through the kitchen</p>
<p>at the end of the hall, on the right side of the house&#x2013;the side where also</p>
<p>the dining room and the parlor were (under &#x201C;my&#x201D; room, on the left, there was</p>
<p>nothing but a garage). In the kitchen, the Negro maid, a plump youngish</p>
<p>woman, said, as she took her large glossy black purse from the knob of the</p>
<p>door leading to the back porch: &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll go now, Mrs. Haze.&#x201D; &#x201C;Yes, Louise,&#x201D;</p>
<p>answered Mrs. Haze with a sigh. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll settle with you Friday.&#x201D; We passed on</p>
<p>to a small pantry and entered the dining room, parallel to the parlor we had</p>
<p>already admired. I noticed a white sock on the floor. With a deprecatory</p>
<p>grunt, Mrs. Haze stooped without stopping and threw it into a closet next to</p>
<p>the pantry. We cursorily inspected a mahogany table with a fruit vase in the</p>
<p>middle, containing nothing but the still glistening stone of one plum. I</p>
<p>groped for the timetable I had in my pocket and surreptitiously fished it</p>
<p>out to look as soon as possible for a train. I was still walking behind Mrs.</p>
<p>Haze though the dining room when, beyond it, there came a sudden burst of</p>
<p>greenery&#x2013;&#x201D;the piazza,&#x201D; sang out my leader, and then, without the least</p>
<p>warning, a blue sea-wave swelled under my heart and, from a mat in a pool of</p>
<p>sun, half-naked, kneeling, turning about on her knees, there was my Riviera</p>
<p>love peering at me over dark glasses.</p>
<p> It was the same child&#x2013;the same frail, honey-hued shoulders, the same</p>
<p>silky supple bare back, the same chestnut head of hair. A polka-dotted black</p>
<p>kerchief tied around her chest hid from my aging ape eyes, but not from the</p>
<p>gaze of young memory, the juvenile breasts I had fondled one immortal day.</p>
<p>And, as if I were the fairy-tale nurse of some little princess (lost,</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (25 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:53file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>kidnapped, discovered in gypsy rags through which her nakedness smiled at the</p>
<p>king and his hounds), I recognized the tiny dark-brown mole on her side.</p>
<p>With awe and delight (the king crying for joy, the trumpets blaring, the</p>
<p>nurse drunk) I saw again her lovely indrawn abdomen where my southbound</p>
<p>mouth had briefly paused; and those puerile hips on which I had kissed the</p>
<p>crenulated imprint left by the band of her shorts&#x2013;that last mad immortal</p>
<p>day behind the &#x201C;Roches Roses.&#x201D; The twenty-five years I had lived since then,</p>
<p>tapered to a palpitating point, and vanished.</p>
<p> I find it most difficult to express with adequate force that flash,</p>
<p>that shiver, that impact of passionate recognition. In the course of the</p>
<p>sun-shot moment that my glance slithered over the kneeling child (her eyes</p>
<p>blinking over those stern dark spectacles&#x2013;the little Herr Doktor who was to</p>
<p>cure me of all my aches) while I passed by her in my adult disguise (a great</p>
<p>big handsome hunk of movieland manhood), the vacuum of my soul managed to</p>
<p>suck in every detail of her bright beauty, and these I checked against the</p>
<p>features of my dead bride. A little later, of course, she, this </p>
<p>nouvelle, this Lolita, my Lolita, was to eclipse completely her</p>
<p>prototype. All I want to stress is that my discovery of her was a fatal</p>
<p>consequence of that &#x201C;princedom by the sea&#x201D; in my tortured past. Everything</p>
<p>between the two events was but a series of gropings and blunders, and false</p>
<p>rudiments of joy. Everything they shared made one of them.</p>
<p> I have no illusions, however. My judges will regard all this as a piece</p>
<p>of mummery on the part of a madman with a gross liking for the fruit</p>
<p>vert. Au fond, &#xE3;a m&#x2019;est bien &#xE8;gal. All I know is that while the</p>
<p>Haze woman and I went down the steps into the breathless garden, my knees</p>
<p>were like reflections of knees in rippling water, and my lips were like</p>
<p>sand, and&#x2013;</p>
<p> &#x201C;That was my Lo,&#x201D; she said, &#x201C;and these are my lilies.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Yes,&#x201D; I said, &#x201C;yes. They are beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.&#x201D;</p>

<p> Exhibit number two is a pocket diary bound in black imitation leather,</p>
<p>with a golden year, 1947, en escalier, in its upper left-hand corner.</p>
<p>I speak of this neat product of the Blank Blank Co., Blankton, Mass., as if</p>
<p>it were really before me. Actually, it was destroyed five years go and what</p>
<p>we examine now (by courtesy of a photographic memory) is but its brief</p>
<p>materialization, a puny unfledged phoenix.</p>
<p> I remember the thing so exactly because I wrote it really twice. First</p>
<p>I jotted down each entry in pencil (with many erasures and corrections) on</p>
<p>the leaves of what is commercially known as a &#x201C;typewriter tablet&#x201D;; then, I</p>
<p>copied it out with obvious abbreviations in my smallest, most satanic, hand</p>

<p>in the little black book just mentioned.</p>
<p> May 30 is a Fast Day by Proclamation in New Hampshire but not in the</p>
<p>Carolinas. That day an epidemic of &#x201C;abdominal flu&#x201D; (whatever that is) forced</p>
<p>Ramsdale to close its schools for the summer. The reader may check the</p>
<p>weather data in the Ramsdale Journal for 1947. A few days before that</p>
<p>I moved into the Haze house, and the little diary which I now propose to</p>
<p>reel off (much as a spy delivers by heart the contents of the note he</p>
<p>swallowed) covers most of June.</p>
<p> Thursday. Very warm day. From a vantage point (bathroom window)</p>
<p>saw Dolores taking things off a clothesline in the apple-green light behind</p>
<p>the house. Strolled out. She wore a plaid shirt, blue jeans and sneakers.</p>
<p>Every movement she made in the dappled sun plucked at the most secret and</p>
<p>sensitive chord of my abject body. After a while she sat down next to me on</p>
<p>the lower step of the back porch and began to pick up the pebbles between</p>
<p>her feet&#x2013;pebbles, my God, then a curled bit of milk-bottle glass resembling</p>
<p>a snarling lip&#x2013;and chuck them at a can. Ping. You can&#x2019;t a second</p>
<p>time&#x2013;you can&#x2019;t hit it&#x2013;oh, marvelous: tender and tanned, not the least</p>
<p>blemish. Sundaes cause acne. The excess of the oily substance called sebum</p>
<p>which nourishes the hair follicles of the skin creates, when too profuse, an</p>
<p>irritation that opens the way to infection. But nymphets do not have acne</p>
<p>although they gorge themselves on rich food. God, what agony, that silky</p>
<p>shimmer above her temple grading into bright brown hair. And the little bone</p>
<p>twitching at the side of her dust-powdered ankle. &#x201C;The McCoo girl? Ginny</p>
<p>McCoo? Oh, she&#x2019;s a fright. And mean. And lame. Nearly died of polio.&#x201D; Ping.</p>
<p>The glistening tracery of down on her forearm. When she got up to take in</p>
<p>the wash, I had a chance of adoring from afar the faded seat of her</p>
<p>rolled-up jeans. Out of the lawn, bland Mrs. Haze, complete with camera,</p>
<p>grew up like a fakir&#x2019;s fake tree and after some heliotropic fussing&#x2013;sad</p>
<p>eyes up, glad eyes down&#x2013;had the cheek of taking my picture as I sat</p>
<p>blinking on the steps, Humbert le Bel.</p>
<p> Friday. Saw her going somewhere with a dark girl called Rose.</p>
<p>Why does the way she walks&#x2013;a child, mind you, a mere child!&#x2013;excite me so</p>
<p>abominably? Analyze it. A faint suggestion of turned in toes. A kind of</p>
<p>wiggly looseness below the knee prolonged to the end of each footfall. The</p>
<p>ghost of a drag. Very infantile, infinitely meretricious. Humbert Humbert is</p>
<p>also infinitely moved by the little one&#x2019;s slangy speech, by her harsh high</p>
<p>voice. Later heard her volley crude nonsense at Rose across the fence.</p>
<p>Twanging through me in a rising rhythm. Pause. &#x201C;I must go now, kiddo.&#x201D;</p>
<p> Saturday. (Beginning perhaps amended.) I know it is madness to</p>
<p>keep this journal but it gives me a strange thrill to do so; and only a</p>
<p>loving wife could decipher my microscopic script. Let me state with a sob</p>
<p>that today my L. was sun-bathing on the so-called &#x201C;piazza,&#x201D; but her mother</p>
<p>and some other woman were around all the time. Of course, I might have sat</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (27 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:53file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>there in the rocker and pretended to read. Playing safe, I kept away, for I</p>
<p>was afraid that the horrible, insane, ridiculous and pitiful tremor that</p>
<p>palsied me might prevent me from making my entr&#xE8;e with any semblance</p>
<p>of casualness.</p>
<p> Sunday. Heat ripple still with us; a most favonian week. This</p>
<p>time I took up a strategic position, with obese newspaper and new pipe, in</p>
<p>the piazza rocker before L. arrived. To my intense disappointment she</p>
<p>came with her mother, both in two-piece bathing suits, black, as new as my</p>
<p>pipe. My darling, my sweetheart stood for a moment near me&#x2013;wanted the</p>
<p>funnies&#x2013;and she smelt almost exactly like the other one, the Riviera one,</p>
<p>but more intensely so, with rougher overtones&#x2013;a torrid odor that at once</p>
<p>set my manhood astir&#x2013;but she had already yanked out of me the coveted</p>
<p>section and retreated to her mat near her phocine mamma. There my beauty lay</p>
<p>down on her stomach, showing me, showing the thousand eyes wide open in my</p>
<p>eyed blood, her slightly raised shoulder blades, and the bloom along the</p>
<p>incurvation of her spine, and the swellings of her tense narrow nates</p>
<p>clothed in black, and the seaside of her schoolgirl thighs. Silently, the</p>
<p>seventh-grader enjoyed her green-red-blue comics. She was the loveliest</p>
<p>nymphet green-red-blue Priap himself could think up. As I looked on, through</p>
<p>prismatic layers of light, dry-lipped, focusing my lust and rocking slightly</p>
<p>under my newspaper, I felt that my perception of her, if properly</p>
<p>concentrated upon, might be sufficient to have me attain a beggar&#x2019;s bliss</p>
<p>immediately; but, like some predator that prefers a moving prey to a</p>
<p>motionless one, I planned to have this pitiful attainment coincide with the</p>
<p>various girlish movements she made now and then as she read, such as trying</p>
<p>to scratch the middle of her back and revealing a stippled armpit&#x2013;but fat</p>
<p>Haze suddenly spoiled everything by turning to me and asking me for a light,</p>
<p>and starting a make-believe conversation about a fake book by some popular</p>
<p>fraud.</p>
<p> Monday. Delectatio morosa. I spend my doleful days in dumps and</p>
<p>dolors. We (mother Haze, Dolores and I) were to go to Our Glass Lake this</p>
<p>afternoon, and bathe, and bask; but a nacreous morn degenerated at noon into</p>
<p>rain, and Lo made a scene.</p>
<p> The median age of pubescence for girls has been found to be thirteen</p>
<p>years and nine months in New York and Chicago. The age varies for</p>
<p>individuals from ten, or earlier, to seventeen. Virginia was not quite</p>
<p>fourteen when Harry Edgar possessed her. He gave her lessons in algebra.</p>
<p>Je m&#x2019;imagine cela. They spent their honeymoon at Petersburg, Fla.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Monsieur Poe-poe,&#x201D; as that boy in one of Monsieur Humbert Humbert&#x2019;s classes</p>
<p>in Paris called the poet-poet.</p>
<p> I have all the characteristics which, according to writers on the sex</p>
<p>interests of children, start the responses stirring in a little girl:</p>
<p>clean-cut jaw, muscular hand, deep sonorous voice, broad shoulder. Moreover,</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (28 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:53file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>I am said to resemble some crooner or actor chap on whom Lo has a crush.</p>
<p> Tuesday. Rain. Lake of the Rains. Mamma out shopping. L., I</p>
<p>knew, was somewhere quite near. In result of some stealthy maneuvering, I</p>
<p>came across her in her mother&#x2019;s bedroom. Prying her left eye open to get rid</p>
<p>of a speck of something. Checked frock. Although I do love that intoxicating</p>
<p>brown fragrance of hers, I really think she should wash her hair once in a</p>
<p>while. For a moment, we were both in the same warm green bath of the mirror</p>
<p>that reflected the top of a poplar with us in the sky. Held her roughly by</p>
<p>the shoulders, then tenderly by the temples, and turned her about. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s</p>
<p>right there,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;I can feel it.&#x201D; &#x201C;Swiss peasant would use the top of</p>
<p>her tongue.&#x201D; &#x201C;Lick it out?&#x201D; &#x201C;Yeth. Shly try?&#x201D; &#x201C;Sure,&#x201D; she said. Gently I</p>
<p>pressed my quivering sting along her rolling salty eyeball. &#x201C;Goody-goody,&#x201D;</p>
<p>she said nictating. &#x201C;It is gone.&#x201D; &#x201C;Now the other?&#x201D; &#x201C;You dope,&#x201D; she</p>
<p>began, &#x201C;there is noth&#x2013;&#x201D; but here she noticed the pucker of my approaching</p>
<p>lips. &#x201C;Okay,&#x201D; she said cooperatively, and bending toward her warm upturned</p>
<p>russet face somber Humbert pressed his mouth to her fluttering eyelid. She</p>
<p>laughed, and brushed past me out of the room. My heart seemed everywhere at</p>
<p>once. Never in my life&#x2013;not even when fondling my child-love in</p>
<p>France&#x2013;never&#x2013;</p>
<p> Night. Never have I experienced such agony. I would like to describe</p>
<p>her face, her ways&#x2013;and I cannot, because my own desire for her blinds me</p>
<p>when she is near. I am not used to being with nymphets, damn it. If I close</p>
<p>my eyes I see but an immobilized fraction of her, a cinematographic still, a</p>
<p>sudden smooth nether loveliness, as with one knee up under her tartan skirt</p>
<p>she sits tying her shoe. &#x201C;Dolores Haze, ne montrez pas vos zhambes&#x201D;</p>
<p>(this is her mother who thinks she knows French).</p>
<p> A poet &#xFE; mes heures, I composed a madrigal to the soot-black</p>
<p>lashes of her pale-gray vacant eyes, to the five asymmetrical freckles on</p>
<p>her bobbed nose, to the blond down of her brown limbs; but I tore it up and</p>
<p>cannot recall it today. Only in the tritest of terms (diary resumed) can I</p>
<p>describe Lo&#x2019;s features: I might say her hair is auburn, and her lips as red</p>
<p>as licked red candy, the lower one prettily plump&#x2013;oh, that I were a lady</p>
<p>writer who could have her pose naked in a naked light! But instead I am</p>
<p>lanky, big-boned, wooly-chested Humbert Humbert, with thick black eyebrows</p>
<p>and a queer accent, and a cesspoolful of rotting monsters behind his slow</p>
<p>boyish smile. And neither is she the fragile child of a feminine novel. What</p>
<p>drives me insane is the twofold nature of this nymphet&#x2013;of every nymphet,</p>
<p>perhaps; this mixture in my Lolita of tender dreamy childishness and a kind</p>
<p>of eerie vulgarity, stemming from the snub-nosed cuteness of ads and</p>
<p>magazine pictures, from the blurry pinkness of adolescent maidservants in</p>
<p>the Old Country (smelling of crushed daisies and sweat); and from very young</p>
<p>harlots disguised as children in provincial brothels; and then again, all</p>
<p>this gets mixed up with the exquisite stainless tenderness seeping through</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (29 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:53file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>the musk and the mud, through the dirt and the death, oh God, oh God. And</p>
<p>what is most singular is that she, this Lolita, my Lolita, has</p>
<p>individualized the writer&#x2019;s ancient lust, so that above and over everything</p>
<p>there is&#x2013;Lolita.</p>
<p> Wednesday. &#x201C;Look, make Mother take you and me to Our Glass Lake</p>
<p>tomorrow.&#x201D; These were the textual words said to me by my twelve-year-old</p>
<p>flame in a voluptuous whisper, as we happened to bump into one another on</p>
<p>the front porch, I out, she in. The reflection of the afternoon sun, a</p>
<p>dazzling white diamond with innumerable iridescent spikes quivered on the</p>
<p>round back of a parked car. The leafage of a voluminous elm played its</p>
<p>mellow shadows upon the clapboard wall of the house. Two poplars shivered</p>
<p>and shook. You could make out the formless sounds of remote traffic; a child</p>
<p>calling &#x201C;Nancy, Nan-cy!&#x201D; In the house, Lolita had put on her favorite</p>
<p>&#x201C;Little Carmen&#x201D; record which I used to call &#x201C;Dwarf Conductors,&#x201D; making her</p>
<p>snort with mock derision at my mock wit.</p>
<p> Thursday. Last night we sat on the piazza, the Haze woman,</p>
<p>Lolita and I. Warm dusk had deepened into amorous darkness. The old girl had</p>
<p>finished relating in great detail the plot of a movie she and L. had seen</p>
<p>sometime in the winter. The boxer had fallen extremely low when he met the</p>
<p>good old priest (who had been a boxer himself in his robust youth and could</p>
<p>still slug a sinner). We sat on cushions heaped on the floor, and L. was</p>
<p>between the woman and me (she had squeezed herself in, the pet). In my turn,</p>
<p>I launched upon a hilarious account of my arctic adventures. The muse of</p>
<p>invention handed me a rifle and I shot a white bear who sat down and said:</p>
<p>Ah! All the while I was acutely aware of L.&#x2019;s nearness and as I spoke I</p>
<p>gestured in the merciful dark and took advantage of those invisible gestures</p>
<p>of mine to touch her hand, her shoulder and a ballerina of wool and gauze</p>
<p>which she played with and kept sticking into my lap; and finally, when I had</p>
<p>completely enmeshed my glowing darling in this weave of ethereal caresses, I</p>
<p>dared stroke her bare leg along the gooseberry fuzz of her shin, and I</p>
<p>chuckled at my own jokes, and trembled, and concealed my tremors, and once</p>
<p>or twice felt with my rapid lips the warmth of her hair as I treated her to</p>
<p>a quick nuzzling, humorous aside and caressed her plaything. She, too,</p>
<p>fidgeted a good deal so that finally her mother told her sharply to quit it</p>
<p>and sent the doll flying into the dark, and I laughed and addressed myself</p>
<p>to Haze across Lo&#x2019;s legs to let my hand creep up my nymphet&#x2019;s thin back and</p>
<p>feel her skin through her boy&#x2019;s shirt.</p>
<p> But I knew it was all hopeless, and was sick with longing, and my</p>
<p>clothes felt miserably tight, and I was almost glad when her mother&#x2019;s quiet</p>
<p>voice announced in the dark: &#x201C;And now we all think that Lo should go to</p>
<p>bed.&#x201D; &#x201C;I think you stink,&#x201D; said Lo. &#x201C;Which means there will be no picnic</p>
<p>tomorrow,&#x201D; said Haze. &#x201C;This is a free country,&#x201D; said Lo. When angry Lo with</p>
<p>a Bronx cheer had gone, I stayed on from sheer inertia, while Haze smoked</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (30 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:53file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>her tenth cigarette of the evening and complained of Lo.</p>
<p> She had been spiteful, if you please, at the age of one, when she used</p>
<p>to throw her toys out of her crib so that her poor mother should keep</p>
<p>picking them up, the villainous infant! Now, at twelve, she was a regular</p>
<p>pest, said Haze. All she wanted from life was to be one day a strutting and</p>
<p>prancing baton twirler or a jitterbug. Her grades were poor, but she was</p>
<p>better adjusted in her new school than in Pisky (Pisky was the Haze home</p>
<p>town in the Middle West. The Ramsdale house was her late mother-in-law&#x2019;s.</p>
<p>They had moved to Ramsdale less than two years ago). &#x201C;Why was she unhappy</p>
<p>there?&#x201D; &#x201C;Oh,&#x201D; said Haze, &#x201C;poor me should know, I went through that when</p>
<p>I was a kid: boys twisting one&#x2019;s arm, banging into one with loads of</p>
<p>books, pulling one&#x2019;s hair, hurting one&#x2019;s breasts, flipping one&#x2019;s skirt. Of</p>
<p>course, moodiness is a common concomitant of growing up, but Lo exaggerates.</p>
<p>Sullen and evasive. Rude and defiant. Struck Viola, an Italian schoolmate,</p>
<p>in the seat with a fountain pen. Know what I would like? If you, monsieur,</p>
<p>happened to be still here in the fall, I&#x2019;d ask you to help her with her</p>
<p>homework&#x2013;you seem to know everything, geography, mathematics, French.&#x201D; &#x201C;Oh,</p>
<p>everything,&#x201D; answered monsieur. &#x201C;That means,&#x201D; said Haze quickly, &#x201C;you&#x2019;ll</p>
<p>be here!&#x201D; I wanted to shout that I would stay on eternally if only I</p>
<p>could hope to caress now and then my incipient pupil. But I was wary of</p>
<p>Haze. So I just grunted and stretched my limbs nonconcomitantly (le mot</p>
<p>juste) and presently went up to my room. The woman, however, was</p>
<p>evidently not prepared to call it a day. I was already lying upon my cold</p>
<p>bed both hands pressing to my face Lolita&#x2019;s fragrant ghost when I heard my</p>
<p>indefatigable landlady creeping stealthily up to my door to whisper through</p>
<p>it&#x2013;just to make sure, she said, I was through with the Glance and Gulp</p>
<p>magazine I had borrowed the other day. From her room Lo yelled she</p>
<p>had it. We are quite a lending library in this house, thunder of God.</p>
<p> Friday. I wonder what my academic publishers would say if I were</p>
<p>to quote in my textbook Ronsard&#x2019;s &#x201C;la vermeillette fente&#x201D; or Remy</p>
<p>Belleau&#x2019;s &#x201C;un petit mont feutr&#xE8; de mousse d&#xE8;licate, trac&#xE8; sur le milieu</p>
<p>d&#x2019;un fillet escarlatte&#x201D; and so forth. I shall probably have another</p>
<p>breakdown if I stay any longer in this house, under the strain of this</p>
<p>intolerable temptation, by the side of my darling&#x2013;my darling&#x2013;my life and</p>
<p>my bride. Has she already been initiated by mother nature to the Mystery of</p>
<p>the Menarche? Bloated feelings. The Curse of the Irish. Falling from the</p>
<p>roof. Grandma is visiting. &#x201C;Mr. Uterus [I quote from a girls&#x2019; magazine]</p>
<p>starts to build a thick soft wall on the chance a possible baby may have to</p>
<p>be bedded down there.&#x201D; The tiny madman in his padded cell.</p>
<p> Incidentally: if I ever commit a serious murder . . . Mark the &#x201C;if.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The urge should be something more than the kind of thing that happened to me</p>
<p>with Valeria. Carefully mark that then was rather inept. If and when</p>
<p>you wish to sizzle me to death, remember that only a spell of insanity could</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (31 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:53file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>ever give me the simple energy to be a brute (all this amended, perhaps).</p>
<p>Sometimes I attempt to kill in my dreams. But do you know what happens? For</p>
<p>instance I hold a gun. For instance I aim at a bland, quietly interested</p>
<p>enemy. Oh, I press the trigger all right, but one bullet after another</p>
<p>feebly drops on the floor from the sheepish muzzle. In those dreams, my only</p>
<p>thought is to conceal the fiasco from my foe, who is slowly growing annoyed.</p>
<p> At dinner tonight the old cat said to me with a sidelong gleam of</p>
<p>motherly mockery directed at Lo (I had just been describing, in a flippant</p>
<p>vein, the delightful little toothbrush mustache I had not quite decided to</p>
<p>grow): &#x201C;Better don&#x2019;t if somebody is not to go absolutely dotty.&#x201D; Instantly</p>
<p>Lo pushed her plate of boiled fish away, all but knocking her milk over, and</p>
<p>bounced out of the dining room. &#x201C;Would it bore you very much,&#x201D; quoth Haze,</p>
<p>&#x201C;to come with us tomorrow for a swim in Our Glass Lake if Lo apologizes for</p>
<p>her manners?&#x201D;</p>
<p> Later, I heard a great banging of doors and other sounds coming from</p>
<p>quaking caverns where the two rivals were having a ripping row.</p>
<p> She had not apologized. The lake is out. It might have been fun.</p>
<p> Saturday. For some days already I had been leaving the door</p>
<p>ajar, while I wrote in my room; but only today did the trap work. With a</p>
<p>good deal of additional fidgeting, shuffling, scraping&#x2013;to disguise her</p>
<p>embarrassment at visiting me without having been called&#x2013;Lo came in and</p>
<p>after pottering around, became interested in the nightmare curlicues I had</p>
<p>penned on a sheet of paper. Oh no: they were not the outcome of a</p>
<p>belle-lettrist&#x2019;s inspired pause between two paragraphs; they were the</p>
<p>hideous hieroglyphics (which she could not decipher) of my fatal lust. As</p>
<p>she bent her brown curs over the desk at which I was sitting, Humbert the</p>
<p>Hoarse put his arm around her in a miserable imitation of</p>
<p>blood-relationship; and still studying, somewhat shortsightedly, the piece</p>
<p>of paper she held, my innocent little visitor slowly sank to a half-sitting</p>
<p>position upon my knee. Her adorable profile, parted lips, warm hair were</p>
<p>some three inches from my bared eyetooth; and I felt the heat of her limbs</p>
<p>through her rough tomboy clothes. All at once I knew I could kiss her throat</p>
<p>or the wick of her mouth with perfect impunity. I knew she would let me do</p>
<p>so, and even close her eyes as Hollywood teaches. A double vanilla with hot</p>
<p>fudge&#x2013;hardly more unusual than that. I cannot tell my learned reader (whose</p>
<p>eyebrows, I suspect, have by now traveled all the way to the back of his</p>
<p>bald head), I cannot tell him how the knowledge came to me; perhaps my</p>
<p>ape-ear had unconsciously caught some slight change in the rhythm of her</p>
<p>respiration&#x2013;for now she was not really looking at my scribble, but waiting</p>
<p>with curiosity and composure&#x2013;oh, my limpid nymphet!&#x2013;for the glamorous</p>
<p>lodger to do what he was dying to do. A modern child, an avid reader of</p>
<p>movie magazines, an expert in dream-slow close-ups, might not think it too</p>
<p>strange, I guessed, if a handsome, intensely virile grown-up friend&#x2013;too</p>

<p>late. The house was suddenly vibrating with voluble Louise&#x2019;s voice telling</p>
<p>Mrs. Haze who had just come home about a dead something she and Leslie</p>
<p>Tomson had found in the basement, and little Lolita was not one to miss such</p>
<p>a tale.</p>
<p> Sunday. Changeful, bad-tempered, cheerful, awkward, graceful</p>
<p>with the tart grace of her coltish subteens, excruciatingly desirable from</p>
<p>head to foot (all New England for a lady-writer&#x2019;s pen!), from the black</p>
<p>read-made bow and bobby pins holding her hair in place to the little scar on</p>
<p>the lower part of her neat calf (where a roller-skater kicked her in Pisky),</p>
<p>a couple of inches above her rough white sock. Gone with her mother to the</p>
<p>Hamiltons&#x2013;a birthday party or something. Full-skirted gingham frock. Her</p>
<p>little doves seem well formed already. Precocious pet!</p>
<p> Monday. Rainy morning. &#x201C;Ces matins gris si doux . . .&#x201D; My</p>
<p>white pajamas have a lilac design on the back. I am like one of those</p>
<p>inflated pale spiders you see in old gardens. Sitting in the middle of a</p>
<p>luminous web and giving little jerks to this or that strand. My web</p>
<p>is spread all over the house as I listen from my chair where I sit like a</p>
<p>wily wizard. Is Lo in her room? Gently I tug on the silk. She is not. Just</p>
<p>heard the toilet paper cylinder make its staccato sound as it is turned; and</p>
<p>no footfalls has my outflung filament traced from the bathroom back to her</p>
<p>room. Is she still brushing her teeth (the only sanitary act Lo performs</p>
<p>with real zest)? No. The bathroom door has just slammed, so one has to feel</p>
<p>elsewhere about the house for the beautiful warm-colored prey. Let us have a</p>
<p>strand of silk descend the stairs. I satisfy myself by this means that she</p>
<p>is not in the kitchen&#x2013;not banging the refrigerator door or screeching at</p>
<p>her detested mamma (who, I suppose, is enjoying her third, cooing and</p>
<p>subduedly mirthful, telephone conversation of the morning). Well, let us</p>
<p>grope and hope. Ray-like, I glide in through to the parlor and find the</p>
<p>radio silent (and mamma still talking to Mrs. Chatfield or Mrs. Hamilton,</p>
<p>very softly, flushed, smiling, cupping the telephone with her free hand,</p>
<p>denying by implication that she denies those amusing rumors, rumor, roomer,</p>
<p>whispering intimately, as she never does, the clear-cut lady, in face to</p>
<p>face talk). So my nymphet is not in the house at all! Gone! What I thought</p>
<p>was a prismatic weave turns out to be but an old gray cobweb, the house is</p>
<p>empty, is dead. And then comes Lolita&#x2019;s soft sweet chuckle through my</p>
<p>half-open door &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t tell Mother but I&#x2019;ve eaten all your bacon.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Gone when I scuttle out of my room. Lolita, where are you? My breakfast</p>
<p>tray, lovingly prepared by my landlady, leers at me toothlessly, ready to be</p>
<p>taken in. Lola, Lolita!</p>
<p> Tuesday. Clouds again interfered with that picnic on that</p>
<p>unattainable lake. Is it Fate scheming? Yesterday I tried on before the</p>
<p>mirror a new pair of bathing trunks.</p>
<p> Wednesday. In the afternoon, Haze (common-sensical shoes,</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (33 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:53file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>tailor-made dress), said she was driving downtown to buy a present for a</p>
<p>friend of a friend of hers, and would I please come too because I have such</p>
<p>a wonderful taste in textures and perfumes. &#x201C;Choose your favorite</p>
<p>seduction,&#x201D; she purred. What could Humbert, being in the perfume business,</p>
<p>do? She had me cornered between the front porch and her car. &#x201C;Hurry up,&#x201D; she</p>
<p>said as I laboriously doubled up my large body in order to crawl in (still</p>
<p>desperately devising a means of escape). She had started the engine, and was</p>
<p>genteelly swearing at a backing and turning truck in front that had just</p>
<p>brought old invalid Miss Opposite a brand new wheel chair, when my Lolita&#x2019;s</p>
<p>sharp voice came from the parlor window: &#x201C;You! Where are you going? I&#x2019;m</p>
<p>coming too! Wait!&#x201D; &#x201C;Ignore her,&#x201D; yelped Haze (killing the motor); alas for</p>
<p>my fair driver; Lo was already pulling at the door on my side. &#x201C;This is</p>
<p>intolerable,&#x201D; began Haze; but Lo had scrambled in, shivering with glee.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Move your bottom, you,&#x201D; said Lo. &#x201C;Lo!&#x201D; cried Haze (sideglancing at me,</p>
<p>hoping I would throw rude Lo out). &#x201C;And behold,&#x201D; said Lo (not for the first</p>
<p>time), as she jerked back, as I jerked back, as the car leapt forward. &#x201C;It</p>
<p>is intolerable,&#x201D; said Haze, violently getting into second, &#x201C;that a child</p>
<p>should be so ill-mannered. And so very persevering. When she knows she is</p>
<p>unwanted. And needs a bath.&#x201D;</p>
<p> My knuckles lay against the child&#x2019;s blue jeans. She was barefooted; her</p>
<p>toenails showed remnants of cherry-red polish and there was a bit of</p>
<p>adhesive tape across her big toe; and, God, what would I not have given to</p>
<p>kiss then and there those delicate-boned, long-toed, monkeyish feet!</p>
<p>Suddenly her hand slipped into mine and without our chaperon&#x2019;s seeing, I</p>
<p>held, and stroked, and squeezed that little hot paw, all the way to the</p>
<p>store. The wings of the diver&#x2019;s Marlenesque nose shone, having shed or</p>
<p>burned up their ration of powder, and she kept up an elegant monologue anent</p>
<p>the local traffic, and smiled in profile, and pouted in profile, and beat</p>
<p>her painted lashes in profile, while I prayed we would never get to that</p>
<p>store, but we did.</p>
<p> I have nothing else to report, save, primo: that big Haze had</p>
<p>little Haze sit behind on our way home, and secundo: that the lady</p>
<p>decided to keep Humbert&#x2019;s Choice for the backs of her own shapely ears.</p>
<p> Thursday. We are paying with hail and gale for the tropical</p>
<p>beginning of the month. In a volume of the Young People&#x2019;s</p>
<p>Encyclopedia, I found a map of the states that a child&#x2019;s pencil had</p>
<p>started copying out on a sheet of lightweight paper, upon the other side of</p>
<p>which, counter to the unfinished outline of Florida and the Gulf, there was</p>
<p>a mimeographed list of names referring, evidently, to her class at the</p>
<p>Ramsdale school. It is a poem I know already by heart.</p>

<p>&#x201C;Haze, Dolores&#x201D; (she!) in its special bower of names, with its bodyguard of</p>
<p>roses&#x2013;a fairy princess between her two maids of honor. I am trying to</p>
<p>analyze the spine-thrill of delight it gives me, this name among all those</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (35 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:53file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>others. What is it that excites me almost to tears (hot, opalescent, thick</p>
<p>tears that poets and lovers shed)? What is it? The tender anonymity of this</p>
<p>name with its formal veil (&#x201C;Dolores&#x201D;) and that abstract transposition of</p>
<p>first name and surname, which is like a pair of new pale gloves or a mask?</p>
<p>Is &#x201C;mask&#x201D; the keyword? Is it because there is always delight in the</p>
<p>semitranslucent mystery, the flowing charshaf, through which the flesh and</p>
<p>the eye you alone are elected to know smile in passing at you alone? Or is</p>
<p>it because I can imagine so well the rest of the colorful classroom around</p>
<p>my dolorous and hazy darling: Grace and her ripe pimples; Ginny and her</p>
<p>lagging leg; Gordon, the haggard masturbator; Duncan, the foul-smelling</p>
<p>clown; nail-biting Agnes; Viola, of the blackheads and the bouncing bust;</p>
<p>pretty Rosaline; dark Mary Rose; adorable Stella, who has let strangers</p>
<p>touch her; Ralph, who bullies and steals; Irving, for whom I am sorry. And</p>
<p>there she is there, lost in the middle, gnawing a pencil, detested by</p>
<p>teachers, all the boys&#x2019; eyes on her hair and neck, my Lolita.</p>
<p> Friday. I long for some terrific disaster. Earthquake.</p>
<p>Spectacular explosion. Her mother is messily but instantly and permanently</p>
<p>eliminated, along with everybody else for miles around. Lolita whimpers in</p>
<p>my arms. A free man, I enjoy her among the ruins. Her surprise, my</p>
<p>explanations, demonstrations, ullulations. Idle and idiotic fancies! A brave</p>
<p>Humbert would have played with her most disgustingly (yesterday, for</p>
<p>instance, when she was again in my room to show me her drawings,</p>
<p>school-artware); he might have bribed her&#x2013;and got away with it. A simpler</p>
<p>and more practical fellow would have soberly stuck to various commercial</p>
<p>substitutes&#x2013;if you know where to go, I don&#x2019;t. Despite my many looks, I am</p>
<p>horribly timid. My romantic soul gets all clammy and shivery at the thought</p>
<p>of running into some awful indecent unpleasantness. Those ribald sea</p>
<p>monsters. &#x201C;Mais allez-y, allez-y!&#x201D; Annabel skipping on one foot to</p>
<p>get into her shorts, I seasick with rage, trying to screen her.</p>
<p> Same date, later, quite late. I have turned on the light to take down a</p>
<p>dream. It had an evident antecedent. Haze at dinner had benevolently</p>
<p>proclaimed that since the weather bureau promised a sunny weekend we would</p>
<p>go to the lake Sunday after church. As I lay in bed, erotically musing</p>
<p>before trying to go to sleep, I thought of a final scheme how to profit by</p>
<p>the picnic to come. I was aware that mother Haze hated my darling for her</p>
<p>being sweet on me. So I planned my lake day with a view to satisfying the</p>
<p>mother. To her alone would I talk; but at some appropriate moment I would</p>
<p>say I had left my wrist watch or my sunglasses in that glade yonder&#x2013;and</p>
<p>plunge with my nymphet into the wood. Reality at this juncture withdrew, and</p>
<p>the Quest for the Glasses turned into a quiet little orgy with a singularly</p>
<p>knowing, cheerful, corrupt and compliant Lolita behaving as reason knew she</p>
<p>could not possibly behave. At 3 a.m. I swallowed a sleeping pill, and</p>
<p>presently, a dream that was not a sequel but a parody revealed to me, with a</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (36 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:53file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>kind of meaningful clarity, the lake I had never yet visited: it was glazed</p>
<p>over with a sheet of emerald ice, and a pockmarked Eskimo was trying in vain</p>
<p>to break it with a pickax, although imported mimosas and oleanders flowered</p>
<p>on its gravelly banks. I am sure Dr. Blanche Schwarzmann would have paid me</p>
<p>a sack of schillings for adding such a libidream to her files.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the rest of it was frankly eclectic. Big Haze and little Haze</p>
<p>rode on horseback around the lake, and I rode too, dutifully bobbing up and</p>
<p>down, bowlegs astraddle although there was no horse between them, only</p>
<p>elastic air&#x2013;one of those little omissions due to the absentmindedness of</p>
<p>the dream agent.</p>
<p> Saturday. My heart is still thumping. I still squirm and emit</p>
<p>low moans of remembered embarrassment.</p>
<p> Dorsal view. Glimpse of shiny skin between T-shirt and white gym</p>
<p>shorts. Bending, over a window sill, in the act of tearing off leaves from a</p>
<p>poplar outside while engrossed in torrential talk with a newspaper boy below</p>
<p>(Kenneth Knight, I suspect) who had just propelled the Ramsdale</p>
<p>Journal with a very precise thud onto the porch. I began creeping up</p>
<p>to her&#x2013;&#x201D;crippling&#x201D; up to her as pantomimists say. My arms and legs were</p>
<p>convex surfaces between which&#x2013;rather than upon which&#x2013;I slowly progressed</p>
<p>by some neutral means of locomotion: Humbert the Wounded Spider. I must have</p>
<p>taken hours to reach her: I seemed to see her through the wrong end of a</p>
<p>telescope, and toward her taut little rear I moved like some paralytic, on</p>
<p>soft distorted limbs, in terrible concentration. At last I was right behind</p>
<p>her when I had the unfortunate idea of blustering a trifle&#x2013;shaking her by</p>
<p>the scruff of the neck and that sort of thing to cover my real</p>
<p>man&#xF5;ge, and she said in a shrill brief whine: &#x201C;Cut it out!&#x201D;&#x2013;most</p>
<p>coarsely, the little wench, and with a ghastly grin Humbert the Humble beat</p>
<p>a gloomy retreat while she went on wisecracking streetward.</p>
<p> But now listen to what happened next. After lunch I was reclining in a</p>
<p>low chair trying to read. Suddenly two deft little hands were over my eyes:</p>
<p>she had crept up from behind as if re-enacting, in a ballet sequence, my</p>
<p>morning maneuver. Her fingers were a luminous crimson as they tried to blot</p>
<p>out the sun, and she uttered hiccups of laughter and jerked this way and</p>
<p>that as I stretched my arm sideways and backwards without otherwise changing</p>
<p>my recumbent position. My hand swept over her agile giggling legs, and the</p>
<p>book like a sleigh left my lap, and Mrs. Haze strolled up and said</p>
<p>indulgently: &#x201C;Just slap her hard if she interferes with your scholarly</p>
<p>meditations. How I love this garden [no exclamation mark in her tone]. Isn&#x2019;t</p>
<p>it divine in the sun [no question mark either].&#x201D; And with a sign of feigned</p>
<p>content, the obnoxious lady sank down on the grass and looked up at the sky</p>
<p>as she leaned back on her splayed-out hands, and presently an old gray</p>
<p>tennis ball bounced over her, and Lo&#x2019;s voice came from the house haughtily:</p>
<p>&#x201C;Pardonnez, Mother. I was not aiming at you.&#x201D; Of course not,</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (37 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:53file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>my hot downy darling.</p>
<p> 12</p>
<p> This proved to be the last of twenty entries or so. It will be seem</p>
<p>from them that for all the devil&#x2019;s inventiveness, the scheme remained daily</p>
<p>the same. First he would tempt me&#x2013;and then thwart me, leaving me with a</p>
<p>dull pain in the very root of my being. I knew exactly what I wanted to do,</p>
<p>and how to do it, without impinging on a child&#x2019;s chastity; after all, I had</p>
<p>had some experience in my life of pederosis; had visually possessed</p>
<p>dappled nymphets in parks; had wedged my wary and bestial way into the</p>
<p>hottest, most crowded corner of a city bus full of straphanging school</p>
<p>children. But for almost three weeks I had been interrupted in all my</p>
<p>pathetic machinations. The agent of these interruptions was usually the Haze</p>
<p>woman (who, as the reader will mark, was more afraid of Lo&#x2019;s deriving some</p>
<p>pleasure from me than of my enjoying Lo). The passion I had developed for</p>
<p>that nymphet&#x2013;for the first nymphet in my life that could be reached at last</p>
<p>by my awkward, aching, timid claws&#x2013;would have certainly landed me again in</p>
<p>a sanatorium, had not the devil realized that I was to be granted some</p>
<p>relief if he wanted to have me as a plaything for some time longer.</p>
<p> The reader has also marked the curious Mirage of the Lake. It would</p>
<p>have been logical on the part of Aubrey McFate (as I would like to dub that</p>
<p>devil of mine) to arrange a small treat for me on the promised beach, in the</p>
<p>presumed forest. Actually, the promise Mrs. Haze had made was a fraudulent</p>
<p>one: she had not told me that Mary Rose Hamilton (a dark little beauty in</p>
<p>her own right) was to come too, and that the two nymphets would be</p>
<p>whispering apart, and playing apart, and having a good time all by</p>
<p>themselves, while Mrs. Haze and her handsome lodger conversed sedately in</p>
<p>the seminude, far from prying eyes. Incidentally, eyes did pry and tongues</p>
<p>did wag. How queer life is! We hasten to alienate the very fates we intended</p>
<p>to woo. Before my actual arrival, my landlady had planned to have an old</p>
<p>spinster, a Miss Phalen, whose mother had been cook in Mrs. Haze&#x2019;s family,</p>
<p>come to stay in the house with Lolita and me, while Mrs. Haze, a career girl</p>
<p>at heart, sought some suitable job in the nearest city. Mrs. Haze had seen</p>
<p>the whole situation very clearly: the bespectacled, round-backed Herr</p>
<p>Humbert coming with his Central-European trunks to gather dust in his corner</p>
<p>behind a heap of old books; the unloved ugly little daughter firmly</p>
<p>supervised by Miss Phalen who had already once had my Lo under her buzzard</p>
<p>wing (Lo recalled that 1944 summer with an indignant shudder); and Mrs. Haze</p>
<p>herself engaged as a receptionist in a great elegant city. But a not too</p>
<p>complicated event interfered with that program. Miss Phalen broke her hip in</p>
<p>Savannah, Ga., on the very day I arrived in Ramsdale.</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (38 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:53file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p> 13</p>
<p> The Sunday after the Saturday already described proved to be as bright</p>
<p>as the weatherman had predicted. When putting the breakfast things back on</p>
<p>the chair outside my room for my good landlady to remove at her convenience,</p>
<p>I gleaned the following situation by listening from the landing across which</p>
<p>I had softly crept to the banisters in my old bedroom slippers&#x2013;the only old</p>
<p>things about me.</p>
<p> There had been another row. Mrs. Hamilton had telephoned that her</p>
<p>daughter &#x201C;was running a temperature.&#x201D; Mrs. Haze informed her daughter</p>
<p>that the picnic would have to be postponed. Hot little Haze informed big</p>
<p>cold Haze that, if so, she would not go with her to church. Mother said very</p>
<p>well and left.</p>
<p> I had come out on the landing straight after shaving, soapy-earlobed,</p>
<p>still in my white pajamas with the cornflower blue (not the lilac) design on</p>
<p>the back; I now wiped off the soap, perfumed my hair and armpits, slipped on</p>
<p>a purple silk dressing gown, and, humming nervously, went down the stairs in</p>
<p>quest of Lo.</p>
<p> I want my learned readers to participate in the scene I am about to</p>
<p>replay; I want them to examine its every detail and see for themselves how</p>
<p>careful, how chaste, the whole wine-sweet event is if viewed with what my</p>
<p>lawyer has called, in a private talk we have had, &#x201C;impartial sympathy.&#x201D; So</p>
<p>let us get started. I have a difficult job before me.</p>
<p> Main character: Humbert the Hummer. Time: Sunday morning in June.</p>
<p>Place: sunlit living room. Props: old, candy-striped davenport, magazines,</p>
<p>phonograph, Mexican knickknacks (the late Mr. Harold E. Haze&#x2013;God bless the</p>
<p>good man&#x2013;had engendered my darling at the siesta hour in a blue-washed</p>
<p>room, on a honeymoon trip to Vera Cruz, and mementoes, among these Dolores,</p>
<p>were all over the place). She wore that day a pretty print dress that I had</p>
<p>seen on her once before, ample in the skirt, tight in the bodice,</p>
<p>short-sleeved, pink, checkered with darker pink, and, to complete the color</p>
<p>scheme, she had painted her lips and was holding in her hollowed hands a</p>
<p>beautiful, banal, Eden-red apple. She was not shod, however, for church. And</p>
<p>her white Sunday purse lay discarded near the phonograph.</p>
<p> My heart beat like a drum as she sat down, cool skirt ballooning,</p>
<p>subsiding, on the sofa next to me, and played with her glossy fruit. She</p>
<p>tossed it up into the sun-dusted air, and caught it&#x2013;it made a cupped</p>
<p>polished plot.</p>
<p> Humbert Humbert intercepted the apple.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Give it back,&#x201D; - she pleaded, showing the marbled flush of her palms.</p>
<p>I produced Delicious. She grasped it and bit into it, and my heart was like</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (39 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:53file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>snow under thin crimson skin, and with the monkeyish nimbleness that was so</p>
<p>typical of that American nymphet, she snatched out of my abstract grip the</p>
<p>magazine I had opened (pity no film had recorded the curious pattern, the</p>
<p>monogrammic linkage of our simultaneous or overlapping moves). Rapidly,</p>
<p>hardly hampered by the disfigured apple she held, Lo flipped violently</p>
<p>through the pages in search of something she wished Humbert to see. Found it</p>
<p>at last. I faked interest by bringing my head so close that her hair touched</p>
<p>my temple and her arm brushed my cheek as she wiped her lips with her wrist.</p>
<p>Because of the burnished mist through which I peered at the picture, I was</p>
<p>slow in reacting to it, and her bare knees rubbed and knocked impatiently</p>
<p>against each other. Dimly there came into view: a surrealist painter</p>
<p>relaxing, supine, on a beach, and near him, likewise supine, a plaster</p>
<p>replica of the Venus di Milo, half-buried in sand. Picture of the Week, said</p>
<p>the legend. I whisked the whole obscene thing away. Next moment, in a sham</p>
<p>effort to retrieve it, she was all over me. Caught her by her thin knobby</p>
<p>wrist. The magazine escaped to the floor like a flustered fowl. She twisted</p>
<p>herself free, recoiled, and lay back in the right-hand corner of the</p>
<p>davenport. Then, with perfect simplicity, the impudent child extended her</p>
<p>legs across my lap.</p>
<p> By this time I was in a state of excitement bordering on insanity; but</p>
<p>I also had the cunning of the insane. Sitting there, on the sofa, I managed</p>
<p>to attune, by a series of stealthy movements, my masked lust to her</p>
<p>guileless limbs. It was no easy matter to divert the little maiden&#x2019;s</p>
<p>attention while I performed the obscure adjustments necessary for the</p>
<p>success of the trick. Talking fast, lagging behind my own breath, catching</p>
<p>up with it, mimicking a sudden toothache to explain the breaks in my</p>
<p>patter&#x2013;and all the while keeping a maniac&#x2019;s inner eye on my distant golden</p>
<p>goal, I cautiously increased the magic friction that was doing away, in an</p>
<p>illusional, if not factual, sense, with the physically irremovable, but</p>
<p>psychologically very friable texture of the material divide (pajamas and</p>
<p>robe) between the weight of two sunburnt legs, resting athwart my lap, and</p>
<p>the hidden tumor of an unspeakable passion. Having, in the course of my</p>
<p>patter, hit upon something nicely mechanical, I recited, garbling them</p>
<p>slightly, the words of a foolish song that was then popular&#x2013;O my Carmen, my</p>
<p>little Carmen, something, something, those something nights, and the stars,</p>
<p>and the cars, and the bars, and the barmen; I kept repeating this automatic</p>
<p>stuff and holding her under its special spell (spell because of the</p>
<p>garbling), and all the while I was mortally afraid that some act of God</p>
<p>might interrupt me, might remove the golden load in the sensation of which</p>
<p>all my being seemed concentrated, and this anxiety forced me to work, for</p>
<p>the first minute or so, more hastily than was consensual with deliberately</p>
<p>modulated enjoyment. The stars that sparkled, and the cars that parkled, and</p>
<p>the bars, and the barmen, were presently taken over by her; her voice stole</p>

<p>and corrected the tune I had been mutilating. She was musical and</p>
<p>apple-sweet. Her legs twitched a little as they lay across my live lap; I</p>
<p>stroked them; there she lolled in the right-hand corner, almost asprawl,</p>
<p>Lola the bobby-soxer, devouring her immemorial fruit, singing through its</p>
<p>juice, losing her slipper, rubbing the heel of her slipperless foot in its</p>
<p>sloppy anklet, against the pile of old magazines heaped on my left on the</p>
<p>sofa&#x2013;and every movement she made, every shuffle and ripple, helped me to</p>
<p>conceal and to improve the secret system of tactile correspondence between</p>
<p>beast and beauty&#x2013;between my gagged, bursting beast and the beauty of her</p>
<p>dimpled body in its innocent cotton frock.</p>
<p> Under my glancing finger tips I felt the minute hairs bristle ever so</p>
<p>slightly along her shins. I lost myself in the pungent but healthy heat</p>
<p>which like summer haze hung about little Haze. Let her stay, let her stay .</p>
<p>. . As she strained to chuck the core of her abolished apple into the</p>
<p>fender, her young weight, her shameless innocent shanks and round bottom,</p>
<p>shifted in my tense, tortured, surreptitiously laboring lap; and all of a</p>
<p>sudden a mysterious change came over my senses. I entered a plane of being</p>
<p>where nothing mattered, save the infusion of joy brewed within my body. What</p>
<p>had begun as a delicious distention of my innermost roots became a glowing</p>
<p>tingle which now had reached that state of absolute security,</p>
<p>confidence and reliance not found elsewhere in conscious life. With the deep</p>
<p>hot sweetness thus established and well on its way to the ultimate</p>
<p>convulsion, I felt I could slow down in order to prolong the glow. Lolita</p>
<p>had been safely solipsized. The implied sun pulsated in the supplied</p>
<p>poplars; we were fantastically and divinely alone; I watched her, rosy,</p>
<p>gold-dusted, beyond the veil of my controlled delight, unaware of it, alien</p>
<p>to it, and the sun was on her lips, and her lips were apparently still</p>
<p>forming the words of the Carmen-barmen ditty that no longer reached my</p>
<p>consciousness. Everything was now ready. The nerves of pleasure had been</p>
<p>laid bare. The corpuscles of Krause were entering the phase of frenzy. The</p>
<p>least pressure would suffice to set all paradise loose. I had ceased to be</p>
<p>Humbert the Hound, the sad-eyed degenerate cur clasping the boot that would</p>
<p>presently kick him away. I was above the tribulations of ridicule, beyond</p>
<p>the possibilities of retribution. In my self-made seraglio, I was a radiant</p>
<p>and robust Turk, deliberately, in the full consciousness of his freedom,</p>
<p>postponing the moment of actually enjoying the youngest and frailest of his</p>
<p>slaves. Suspended on the brink of that voluptuous abyss (a nicety of</p>
<p>physiological equipoise comparable to certain techniques in the arts) I kept</p>
<p>repeating the chance words after her&#x2013;barmen, alarmin&#x2019;, my charmin&#x2019;, my</p>
<p>carmen, ahmen, ahahamen&#x2013;as one talking and laughing in his sleep while my</p>
<p>happy hand crept up her sunny leg as far as the shadow of decency allowed.</p>
<p>The day before she had collided with the heavy chest in the hall and&#x2013;&#x201D;Look,</p>
<p>look!&#x201D;&#x2013;I gasped&#x2013;&#x201D;look what you&#x2019;ve done, what you&#x2019;ve done to yourself, ah,</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (41 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:53file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>look&#x201D;; for there was, I swear, a yellowish-violet bruise on her lovely</p>
<p>nymphet thigh which my huge hairy hand massaged and slowly enveloped&#x2013;and</p>
<p>because of her very perfunctory underthings, there seemed to be nothing to</p>
<p>prevent my muscular thumb from reaching the hot hollow of her groin&#x2013;just as</p>
<p>you might tickle and caress a giggling child&#x2013;just that&#x2013;and: &#x201C;Oh, it&#x2019;s</p>
<p>nothing at all,&#x201D; she cried with a sudden shrill note in her voice, and she</p>
<p>wiggled, and squirmed, and threw her head back, and her teeth rested on her</p>
<p>glistening underlip as she half-turned away, and my moaning mouth, gentlemen</p>
<p>of the jury, almost reached her bare neck, while I crushed out against her</p>
<p>left buttock the last throb of the longest ecstasy man or monster had ever</p>
<p>known.</p>
<p> Immediately afterward (as if we had been struggling and now my grip had</p>
<p>eased) she rolled off the sofa and jumped to her feet&#x2013;to her foot,</p>
<p>rather&#x2013;in order to attend to the formidably loud telephone that may have</p>
<p>been ringing for ages as far as I was concerned. There she stood and</p>
<p>blinked, cheeks aflame, hair awry, her eyes passing over me as lightly as</p>
<p>they did over the furniture, and as she listened or spoke (to her mother who</p>
<p>was telling her to come to lunch with her at the Chatfileds&#x2013;neither Lo nor</p>
<p>Hum knew yet what busybody Haze was plotting), she kept tapping the edge of</p>
<p>the table with the slipper she held in her hand. Blessed be the Lord, she</p>
<p>had noticed nothing!</p>
<p> With a handkerchief of multicolored silk, on which her listening eyes</p>
<p>rested in passing, I wiped the sweat off my forehead, and, immersed in a</p>
<p>euphoria of release, rearranged my royal robes. She was still at the</p>
<p>telephone, haggling with her mother (wanted to be fetched by car, my little</p>
<p>Carmen) when, singing louder and louder, I swept up the stairs and set a</p>
<p>deluge of steaming water roaring into the tub.</p>
<p> At this point I may as well give the words of that song hit in full&#x2013;to</p>
<p>the best of my recollection at least&#x2013;I don&#x2019;t think I ever had it right.</p>
<p>Here goes:</p>
<p> O my Carmen, my little Carmen!</p>
<p> Something, something those something nights,</p>
<p> And the stars, and the cars, and the bars and the barmen&#x2013;</p>
<p> And, O my charmin&#x2019;, our dreadful fights.</p>
<p> And the something town where so gaily, arm in</p>
<p> Arm, we went, and our final row,</p>
<p> And the gun I killed you with, O my Carmen,</p>
<p> The gun I am holding now.</p>
<p> (Drew his .32 automatic, I guess, and put a bullet through his moll&#x2019;s</p>
<p>eye.)</p>

<p> 14</p>
<p> I had lunch in town&#x2013;had not been so hungry for years. The house was</p>
<p>still Lo-less when I strolled back. I spent the afternoon musing, scheming,</p>
<p>blissfully digesting my experience of the morning.</p>
<p> I felt proud of myself. I had stolen the honey of a spasm without</p>
<p>impairing the morals of a minor. Absolutely no harm done. The conjurer had</p>
<p>poured milk, molasses, foaming champagne into a young lady&#x2019;s new white</p>
<p>purse; and lo, the purse was intact. Thus had I delicately constructed my</p>
<p>ignoble, ardent, sinful dream; and still Lolita was safe&#x2013;and I was safe.</p>
<p>What I had madly possessed was not she, but my own creation, another,</p>
<p>fanciful Lolita&#x2013;perhaps, more real than Lolita; overlapping, encasing her;</p>
<p>floating between me and her, and having no will, no consciousness&#x2013;indeed,</p>
<p>no life of her own.</p>
<p> The child knew nothing. I had done nothing to her. And nothing</p>
<p>prevented me from repeating a performance that affected her as little as if</p>
<p>she were a photographic image rippling upon a screen and I a humble</p>
<p>hunchback abusing myself in the dark. The afternoon drifted on and on, in</p>
<p>ripe silence, and the sappy tall trees seemed to be in the know; and desire,</p>
<p>even stronger than before, began to afflict me again. Let her come soon, I</p>
<p>prayed, addressing a loan God, and while mamma is in the kitchen, let a</p>
<p>repetition of the davenport scene be staged, please, I adore her so</p>
<p>horribly.</p>
<p> No: &#x201C;horribly&#x201D; is the wrong word. The elation with which the vision of</p>
<p>new delights filled me was not horrible but pathetic. I qualify it as</p>
<p>pathetic. Pathetic&#x2013;because despite the insatiable fire of my venereal</p>
<p>appetite, I intended, with the most fervent force and foresight, to protect</p>
<p>the purity of that twelve-year-old child.</p>
<p> And now see how I was repaid for my pains. No Lolita came home&#x2013;she had</p>
<p>gone with the Chatfields to a movie. The table was laid with more elegance</p>
<p>than usual: candlelight, if you please. In this mawkish aura, Mrs. Haze</p>
<p>gently touched the silver on both sides of her plate as if touching piano</p>
<p>keys, and smiled down on her empty plate (was on a diet), and said she hoped</p>
<p>I liked the salad (recipe lifted from a woman&#x2019;s magazine). She hoped I liked</p>
<p>the cold cuts, too. It had been a perfect day. Mrs. Chatfield was a lovely</p>
<p>person. Phyllis, her daughter, was going to a summer camp tomorrow. For</p>
<p>three weeks. Lolita, it was decided, would go Thursday. Instead of waiting</p>
<p>till July, as had been initially planned. And stay there after Phyllis had</p>
<p>left. Till school began. A pretty prospect, my heart.</p>
<p> Oh, how I was taken aback&#x2013;for did it not mean I was losing my darling,</p>
<p>just when I had secretly made her mine? To explain my grim mood, I had to</p>
<p>use the same toothache I had already simulated in the morning. Must have</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (43 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:53file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>been an enormous molar, with an abscess as big as a maraschino cherry.</p>
<p> &#x201C;We have,&#x201D; said Haze, &#x201C;an excellent dentist. Our neighbor, in fact. Dr.</p>
<p>Quilty. Uncle or cousin, I think, of the playwright. Think it will pass?</p>
<p>Well, just as you wish. In the fall I shall have him &#x2018;brace&#x2019; her, as my</p>
<p>mother used to say. It may curb Lo a little. I am afraid she has been</p>
<p>bothering you frightfully all these days. And we are in for a couple of</p>
<p>stormy ones before she goes. She has flatly refused to go, and I confess I</p>
<p>left her with the Chatfields because I dreaded to face her alone just yet.</p>
<p>The movie may mollify her. Phyllis is a very sweet girl, and there is no</p>
<p>earthly reason for Lo to dislike her. Really, monsieur, I am very sorry</p>
<p>about that tooth of yours. It would be so much more reasonable to let me</p>
<p>contact Ivor Quilty first thing tomorrow morning if it still hurts. And, you</p>
<p>know, I think a summer camp is so much healthier, and&#x2013;well, it is all so</p>
<p>much more reasonable as I say than to mope on a suburban lawn and use</p>
<p>mamma&#x2019;s lipstick, and pursue shy studious gentlemen, and go into tantrums at</p>
<p>the least provocation.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Are you sure,&#x201D; I said at last, &#x201C;that she will be happy there?&#x201D; (lame,</p>
<p>lamentably lame!)</p>
<p> &#x201C;She&#x2019;d better,&#x201D; said Haze. &#x201C;And it won&#x2019;t be all play either. The camp</p>
<p>is run by Shirley Holmes&#x2013;you know, the woman who wrote Campfire</p>
<p>Girl. Camp will teach Dolores Haze to grow in many things&#x2013;health,</p>
<p>knowledge, temper. And particularly in a sense of responsibility towards</p>
<p>other people. Shall we take these candles with us and sit for a while on the</p>
<p>piazza, or do you want to go to bed and nurse that tooth?&#x201D;</p>
<p> Nurse that tooth.</p>
<p> 15</p>
<p> Next day they drove downtown to buy things needed for the camp: any</p>
<p>wearable purchase worked wonders with Lo. She seemed her usual sarcastic</p>
<p>self at dinner. Immediately afterwards, she went up to her room to plunge</p>
<p>into the comic books acquired for rainy days at Camp Q (they were so</p>
<p>thoroughly sampled by Thursday that she left them behind). I too retired to</p>
<p>my lair, and wrote letters. My plan now was to leave for the seaside and</p>
<p>then, when school began, resume my existence in the Haze household; for I</p>
<p>knew already that I could not live without the child. On Tuesday they went</p>
<p>shopping again, and I was asked to answer the phone if the camp mistress</p>
<p>rang up during their absence. She did; and a month or so later we had</p>
<p>occasion to recall our pleasant chat. That Tuesday, Lo had her dinner in her</p>
<p>room. She had been crying after a routine row with her mother and, as had</p>
<p>happened on former occasions, had not wished me to see her swollen eyes: she</p>
<p>had one of those tender complexions that after a good cry get all blurred</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (44 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:53file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>and inflamed, and morbidly alluring. I regretted keenly her mistake about my</p>
<p>private aesthetics, for I simply love that tinge of Botticellian pink, that</p>
<p>raw rose about the lips, those wet, matted eyelashes; and, naturally, her</p>
<p>bashful whim deprived me of many opportunities of specious consolation.</p>
<p>There was, however, more to it than I thought. As we sat in the darkness of</p>
<p>the verandah (a rude wind had put out her red candles), Haze, with a dreary</p>
<p>laugh, said she had told Lo that her beloved Humbert thoroughly approved of</p>
<p>the whole camp idea &#x201C;and now,&#x201D; added Haze, &#x201C;the child throws a fit; pretext:</p>
<p>you and I want to get rid of her; actual reason: I told her we would</p>
<p>exchange tomorrow for plainer stuff some much too cute night things that she</p>
<p>bullied me into buying for her. You see, she sees herself as a</p>
<p>starlet; I see her as a sturdy, healthy, but decidedly homely kid.</p>
<p>This, I guess, is at the root of our troubles.&#x201D;</p>
<p> On Wednesday I managed to waylay Lo for a few seconds: she was on the</p>
<p>landing, in sweatshirt and green-stained white shorts, rummaging in a trunk.</p>
<p>I said something meant to be friendly and funny but she only emitted a snort</p>
<p>without looking at me. Desperate, dying Humbert patted her clumsily on her</p>
<p>coccyx, and she struck him, quite painfully, with one of the late Mr. Haze&#x2019;s</p>
<p>shoetrees. &#x201C;Doublecrosser,&#x201D; she said as I crawled downstairs rubbing my arm</p>
<p>with a great show of rue. She did not condescend to have dinner with Hum and</p>
<p>mum: washed her hair and went to bed with her ridiculous books. And on</p>
<p>Thursday quiet Mrs. Haze drove her to Camp Q.</p>
<p> As greater authors than I have put it: &#x201C;Let readers imagine&#x201D; etc. On</p>
<p>second thought, I may as well give those imaginations a kick in the pants. I</p>
<p>knew I had fallen in love with Lolita forever; but I also knew she would not</p>
<p>be forever Lolita. She would be thirteen on January 1. In two years or so</p>
<p>she would cease being a nymphet and would turn into a &#x201C;young girl,&#x201D; and</p>
<p>then, into a &#x201C;college girl&#x201D;&#x2013;that horror of horrors. The word &#x201C;forever&#x201D;</p>
<p>referred only to my own passion, to the eternal Lolita as reflected in my</p>
<p>blood. The Lolita whose iliac crests had not yet flared, the Lolita that</p>
<p>today I could touch and smell and hear and see, the Lolita of the strident</p>
<p>voice and rich brown hair&#x2013;of the bangs and the swirls and the sides and the</p>
<p>curls at the back, and the sticky hot neck, and the vulgar</p>
<p>vocabulary&#x2013;&#x201D;revolting,&#x201D; &#x201C;super,&#x201D; &#x201C;luscious,&#x201D; &#x201C;goon,&#x201D; &#x201C;drip&#x201D;&#x2013;that</p>
<p>Lolita, my Lolita, poor Catullus would lose forever. So how could I</p>
<p>afford not to see her for two months of summer insomnias? Two whole months</p>
<p>out of the two years of her remaining nymphage! Should I disguise myself as</p>
<p>a somber old-fashioned girl, gawky Mlle Humbert, and put up my tent on the</p>
<p>outskirts of Camp Q, in the hope that its russet nymphets would clamor: &#x201C;Let</p>
<p>us adopt that deep-voiced D.P.,&#x201D; and drag the said, shyly smiling Berthe</p>
<p>au Grand Pied to their rustic hearth. Berthe will sleep with Dolores</p>
<p>Haze!</p>
<p> Idle dry dreams. Two months of beauty, two months of tenderness, would</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (45 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:53file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>be squandered forever, and I could do nothing about it, but nothing, mais</p>
<p>rien.</p>
<p> One drop of rare honey, however, that Thursday did hold in its acorn</p>
<p>cup. Haze was to drive her to the camp in the early morning. Upon sundry</p>
<p>sounds of departure reaching me, I rolled out of bed and leaned out of the</p>
<p>window. Under the poplars, the car was already athrob. On the sidewalk,</p>
<p>Louise stood shading her eyes with her hand, as if the little traveler were</p>
<p>already riding into the low morning sun. The gesture proved to be premature.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Hurry up!&#x201D; shouted Haze. My Lolita, who was half in and about to slam the</p>
<p>car door, wind down the glass, wave to Louise and the poplars (whom and</p>
<p>which she was never to see again), interrupted the motion of fate: she</p>
<p>looked up&#x2013;and dashed back into the house (Haze furiously calling after</p>
<p>her). A moment later I heard my sweetheart running up the stairs. My heart</p>
<p>expanded with such force that it almost blotted me out. I hitched up the</p>
<p>pants of my pajamas, flung the door open: and simultaneously Lolita arrived,</p>
<p>in her Sunday frock, stamping, panting, and then she was in my arms, her</p>
<p>innocent mouth melting under the ferocious pressure of dark male jaws, my</p>
<p>palpitating darling! The next instant I heart her&#x2013;alive, unraped&#x2013;clatter</p>
<p>downstairs. The motion of fate was resumed. The blond leg was pulled in, the</p>
<p>car door was slammed&#x2013;was re-slammed&#x2013;and driver Haze at the violent wheel,</p>
<p>rubber-red lips writhing in angry, inaudible speech, swung my darling away,</p>
<p>while unnoticed by them or Louise, old Miss Opposite, an invalid, feebly but</p>
<p>rhythmically waved from her vined verandah.</p>
<p> 16</p>
<p> The hollow of my hand was still ivory-full of Lolita&#x2013;full of the feel</p>
<p>of her pre-adolescently incurved back, that ivory-smooth, sliding sensation</p>
<p>of her skin through the thin frock that I had worked up and down while I</p>
<p>held her. I marched into her tumbled room, threw open the door of the</p>
<p>closet, and plunged into a heap of crumpled things that had touched her.</p>
<p>There was particularly one pink texture, sleazy, torn, with a faintly acrid</p>
<p>odor in the seam. I wrapped in it Humbert&#x2019;s huge engorged heart. A poignant</p>
<p>chaos was welling within me&#x2013;but I had to drop those things and hurriedly</p>
<p>regain my composure, as I became aware of the maid&#x2019;s velvety voice calling</p>
<p>me softly from the stairs. She had a message for me, she said; and, topping</p>
<p>my automatic thanks with a kindly &#x201C;you&#x2019;re welcome,&#x201D; good Louise left an</p>
<p>unstamped, curiously clean-looking letter in my shaking hand.</p>
<p> &#x201C;This is a confession. I love you [so the letter began; and for a</p>
<p>distorted moment I mistook its hysterical scrawl for a schoolgirl&#x2019;s</p>
<p>scribble]. Last Sunday in church&#x2013;bad you, who refused to come to see our</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (46 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:53file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>beautiful new windows!&#x2013;only last Sunday, my dear one, when I asked the Lord</p>
<p>what to do about it, I was told to act as I am acting now. You see, there is</p>
<p>no alternative. I have loved you from the minute I saw you. I am a</p>
<p>passionate and lonely woman and you are the love of my life.</p>
<p> Now, my dearest, dearest, mon cher, cher monsieur, you have read</p>
<p>this; now you know. So, will you please, at once, pack and leave.</p>
<p>This is a landlady&#x2019;s order. I am dismissing a lodger. I am kicking you out.</p>
<p>Go! Scram! Departez! I shall be back by dinnertime, if I do eighty</p>
<p>both ways and don&#x2019;t have an accident (but what would it matter?), and I do</p>
<p>not wish to find you in the house. Please, please, leave at once,</p>
<p>now, do not even read this absurd note to the end. Go. Adieu.</p>
<p> The situation, ch&#xE8;ri, is quite simple. Of course, I know with</p>
<p>absolute certainty that I am nothing to you, nothing at all to you,</p>
<p>nothing at all. Oh yes, you enjoy talking to me (and kidding poor me), you</p>
<p>have grown fond of our friendly house, of the books I like, of my lovely</p>
<p>garden, even of Lo&#x2019;s noisy ways&#x2013;but I am nothing to you. Right? Right.</p>
<p>Nothing to you whatever. But if, after reading my &#x201C;confession,&#x201D; you</p>
<p>decided, in your dark romantic European way, that I am attractive enough for</p>
<p>you to take advantage of my letter and make a pass at me, then you would be</p>
<p>a criminal&#x2013;worse than a kidnaper who rapes a child. You see, ch&#xE8;ri.</p>
<p>If you decided to stay, if I found you at home (which I know I</p>
<p>won&#x2019;t&#x2013;and that&#x2019;s why I am able to go on like this), the fact of your</p>
<p>remaining would only mean one thing: that you want me as much as I do you:</p>
<p>as a lifelong mate; and that you are ready to link up your life with mine</p>
<p>forever and ever and be a father to my little girl.</p>
<p> Let me rave and ramble on for a teeny while more, my dearest, since I</p>
<p>know this letter has been by now torn by you, and its pieces (illegible) in</p>
<p>the vortex of the toilet. My dearest, mon tr&#xF5;s, tr&#xF5;s cher, what a</p>
<p>world of love I have built up for you during this miraculous June! I know</p>
<p>how reserved you are, how &#x201C;British.&#x201D; Your old-world reticence, your sense of</p>
<p>decorum may be shocked by the boldness of an American girl! You who conceal</p>
<p>your strongest feelings must think me a shameless little idiot for throwing</p>
<p>open my poor bruised heart like this. In years gone by, many disappointments</p>
<p>came my way. Mr. Haze was a splendid person, a sterling soul, but he</p>
<p>happened to be twenty years my senior, and&#x2013;well, let us not gossip about</p>
<p>the past. My dearest, your curiosity must be well satisfied if you have</p>
<p>ignored my request and read this letter to the bitter end. Never mind.</p>
<p>Destroy it and go. Do not forget to leave the key on the desk in your room.</p>
<p>And some scrap of address so that I could refund the twelve dollars I owe</p>
<p>you till the end of the month. Good-bye, dear one. Pray for me&#x2013;if you ever</p>
<p>pray.</p>
<p> C.H.&#x201D;</p>

<p> What I present here is what I remember of the letter, and what I</p>
<p>remember of the letter I remember verbatim (including that awful French). It</p>
<p>was at least twice longer. I have left out a lyrical passage which I more or</p>
<p>less skipped at the time, concerning Lolita&#x2019;s brother who died at 2 when she</p>
<p>was 4, and how much I would have liked him. Let me see what else can I say?</p>
<p>Yes. There is just a chance that &#x201C;the vortex of the toilet&#x201D; (where the</p>
<p>letter did go) is my own matter-of-fact contribution. She probably begged me</p>
<p>to make a special fire to consume it.</p>
<p> My first movement was one of repulsion and retreat. My second was like</p>
<p>a friend&#x2019;s calm hand falling upon my shoulder and bidding me take my time. I</p>
<p>did. I came out of my daze and found myself still in Lo&#x2019;s room. A full-page</p>
<p>ad ripped out of a slick magazine was affixed to the wall above the bed,</p>
<p>between a crooner&#x2019;s mug and the lashes of a movie actress. It represented a</p>
<p>dark-haired young husband with a kind of drained look in his Irish eyes. He</p>
<p>was modeling a robe by So-and-So and holding a bridgelike tray by So-and-So,</p>
<p>with breakfast for two. The legend, by the Rev. Thomas Morell, called him a</p>
<p>&#x201C;conquering hero.&#x201D; The thoroughly conquered lady (not shown) was presumably</p>
<p>propping herself up to receive her half of the tray. How her bed-fellow was</p>
<p>to get under the bridge without some messy mishap was not clear. Lo had</p>
<p>drawn a jocose arrow to the haggard lover&#x2019;s face and had put, in block</p>
<p>letters: H.H. And indeed, despite a difference of a few years, the</p>
<p>resemblance was striking. Under this was another picture, also a colored ad.</p>
<p>A distinguished playwright was solemnly smoking a Drome. He always smoked</p>
<p>Dromes. The resemblance was slight. Under this was Lo&#x2019;s chase bed, littered</p>
<p>with &#x201C;comics.&#x201D; The enamel had come off the bedstead, leaving black, more or</p>
<p>less rounded, marks on the white. Having convinced myself that Louise had</p>
<p>left, I got into Lo&#x2019;s bed and reread the letter.</p>
<p> 17</p>
<p> Gentlemen of the jury! I cannot swear that certain motions pertaining</p>
<p>to the business in hand&#x2013;if I may coin an expression&#x2013;had not drifted across</p>
<p>my mind before. My mind had not retained them in any logical form or in any</p>
<p>relation to definitely recollected occasions; but I cannot swear&#x2013;let me</p>
<p>repeat&#x2013;that I had not toyed with them (to rig up yet another expression),</p>
<p>in my dimness of thought, in my darkness of passion. There may have been</p>
<p>times&#x2013;there must have been times, if I know my Humbert&#x2013;when I had brought</p>
<p>up for detached inspection the idea of marrying a mature widow (say,</p>
<p>Charlotte Haze) with not one relative left in the wide gray world, merely in</p>
<p>order to have my way with her child (Lo, Lola, Lolita). I am even prepared</p>
<p>to tell my tormentors that perhaps once or twice I had cast an appraiser&#x2019;s</p>
<p>cold eye at Charlotte&#x2019;s coral lips and bronze hair and dangerously low</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (48 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:53file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>neckline, and had vaguely tried to fit her into a plausible daydream. This I</p>
<p>confess under torture. Imaginary torture, perhaps, but all the more</p>
<p>horrible. I wish I might digress and tell you more of the pavor</p>
<p>nocturnus that would rack me at night hideously after a chance term had</p>
<p>struck me in the random readings of my boyhood, such as peine forte et</p>
<p>dure (what a Genius of Pain must have invented that!) or the dreadful,</p>
<p>mysterious, insidious words &#x201C;trauma,&#x201D; &#x201C;traumatic event,&#x201D; and &#x201C;transom.&#x201D; But</p>
<p>my tale is sufficiently incondite already.</p>
<p> After a while I destroyed the letter and went to my room, and</p>
<p>ruminated, and rumpled my hair, and modeled my purple robe, and moaned</p>
<p>through clenched teeth and suddenly&#x2013;Suddenly, gentlemen of the jury, I felt</p>
<p>a Dostoevskian grin dawning (through the very grimace that twisted my lips)</p>
<p>like a distant and terrible sun. I imagined (under conditions of new and</p>
<p>perfect visibility) all the casual caresses her mother&#x2019;s husband would be</p>
<p>able to lavish on his Lolita. I would hold her against me three times a day,</p>
<p>every day. All my troubles would be expelled, I would be a healthy man. &#x201C;To</p>
<p>hold thee lightly on a gentle knee and print on thy soft cheek a parent&#x2019;s</p>
<p>kiss . . .&#x201D; Well-read Humbert!</p>
<p> Then, with all possible caution, on mental tiptoe so to speak, I</p>
<p>conjured up Charlotte as a possible mate. By God, I could make myself bring</p>
<p>her that economically halved grapefruit, that sugarless breakfast.</p>
<p> Humbert Humbert sweating in the fierce white light, and howled at, and</p>
<p>trodden upon by sweating policemen, is now ready to make a further</p>
<p>&#x201C;statement&#x201D; (quel mot!) as he turns his conscience inside out and</p>
<p>rips off its innermost lining. I did not plan to marry poor Charlotte in</p>
<p>order to eliminate her in some vulgar, gruesome and dangerous manner such as</p>
<p>killing her by placing five bichloride-of-mercury tablets in her preprandial</p>
<p>sherry or anything like that; but a delicately allied, pharmacopoeial</p>
<p>thought did tinkle in my sonorous and clouded brain. Why limit myself to the</p>
<p>modest masked caress I had tried already? Other visions of venery presented</p>
<p>themselves to me swaying and smiling. I saw myself administering a powerful</p>
<p>sleeping potion to both mother and daughter so as to fondle the latter</p>
<p>though the night with perfect impunity. The house was full of Charlotte&#x2019;s</p>
<p>snore, while Lolita hardly breathed in her sleep, as still as a painted</p>
<p>girl-child. &#x201C;Mother, I swear Kenny never even touched me.&#x201D; &#x201C;You</p>
<p>either lie, Dolores Haze, or it was an incubus.&#x201D; No, I would not go that</p>
<p>far.</p>
<p> So Humbert the Cubus schemed and dreamed&#x2013;and the red sun of desire and</p>
<p>decision (the two things that create a live world) rose higher and higher,</p>
<p>while upon a succession of balconies a succession of libertines, sparkling</p>
<p>glass in hand, toasted the bliss of past and future nights. Then,</p>
<p>figuratively speaking, I shattered the glass, and boldly imagined (for I was</p>
<p>drunk on those visions by then and underrated the gentleness of my nature)</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (49 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:53file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>how eventually I might blackmail&#x2013;no, that it too strong a word&#x2013;mauvemail</p>
<p>big Haze into letting me consort with the little Haze by gently threatening</p>
<p>the poor doting Big Dove with desertion if she tried to bar me from playing</p>
<p>with my legal stepdaughter. In a word, before such an Amazing Offer, before</p>
<p>such a vastness and variety of vistas, I was as helpless as Adam at the</p>
<p>preview of early oriental history, miraged in his apple orchard.</p>
<p> And now take down the following important remark: the artist in me has</p>
<p>been given the upper hand over the gentleman. It is with a great effort of</p>
<p>will that in this memoir I have managed to tune my style to the tone of the</p>
<p>journal that I kept when Mrs. Haze was to me but an obstacle. That journal</p>
<p>of mine is no more; but I have considered it my artistic duty to preserve</p>
<p>its intonations no matter how false and brutal they may seem to me now.</p>
<p>Fortunately, my story has reached a point where I can cease insulting poor</p>
<p>Charlotte for the sake of retrospective verisimilitude.</p>
<p> Wishing to spare poor Charlotte two or three hours of suspense on a</p>
<p>winding road (and avoid, perhaps, a head-on collision that would shatter our</p>
<p>different dreams), I made a thoughtful but abortive attempt to reach her at</p>
<p>the camp by telephone. She had left half an hour before, and getting Lo</p>
<p>instead, I told her&#x2013;trembling and brimming with my mastery over fate&#x2013;that</p>
<p>I was going to marry her mother. I had to repeat it twice because something</p>
<p>was preventing her from giving me her attention. &#x201C;Gee, that&#x2019;s swell,&#x201D; she</p>
<p>said laughing. &#x201C;When is the wedding? Hold on a sec, the pup&#x2013;That put here</p>
<p>has got hold of my sock. Listen&#x2013;&#x201D; and she added she guessed she was going</p>
<p>to have loads of fun . . . and I realized as I hung up that a couple of</p>
<p>hours at that camp had been sufficient to blot out with new impressions the</p>
<p>image of handsome Humbert Humbert from little Lolita&#x2019;s mind. But what did it</p>
<p>matter now? I would get her back as soon as a decent amount of time after</p>
<p>the wedding had elapsed. &#x201C;The orange blossom would have scarcely withered on</p>
<p>the grave,&#x201D; as a poet might have said. But I am no poet. I am only a very</p>
<p>conscientious recorder.</p>
<p> After Louise had gone, I inspected the icebox, and finding it much too</p>
<p>puritanic, walked to town and bought the richest foods available. I also</p>
<p>bought some good liquor and two or three kinds of vitamins. I was pretty</p>
<p>sure that with the aid of these stimulants and my natural resources, I would</p>
<p>avert any embarrassment that my indifference might incur when called upon to</p>
<p>display a strong and impatient flame. Again and again resourceful Humbert</p>
<p>evoked Charlotte as seen in the raree-show of a manly imagination. She was</p>
<p>well groomed and shapely, this I could say for her, and she was my Lolita&#x2019;s</p>
<p>big sister&#x2013;this notion, perhaps, I could keep up if only I did not</p>
<p>visualize too realistically her heavy hips, round knees, ripe bust, the</p>
<p>coarse pink skin of her neck (&#x201C;coarse&#x201D; by comparison with silk and honey)</p>
<p>and all the rest of that sorry and dull thing: a handsome woman.</p>
<p> The sun made its usual round of the house as the afternoon ripened into</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (50 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:53file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>evening. I had a drink. And another. And yet another. Gin and pineapple</p>
<p>juice, my favorite mixture, always double my energy. I decided to busy</p>
<p>myself with our unkempt lawn. Une petite attention. It was crowded</p>
<p>with dandelions, and a cursed dog&#x2013;I loathe dogs&#x2013;had defiled the flat</p>
<p>stones where a sundial had once stood. Most of the dandelions had changed</p>
<p>from suns to moons. The gin and Lolita were dancing in me, and I almost fell</p>
<p>over the folding chairs that I attempted to dislodge. Incarnadine zebras!</p>
<p>There are some eructations that sound like cheers&#x2013;at least, mine did. An</p>
<p>old fence at the back of the garden separated us from the neighbor&#x2019;s garbage</p>
<p>receptacles and lilacs; but there was nothing between the front end of our</p>
<p>lawn (where it sloped along one side of the house) and the street. Therefore</p>
<p>I was able to watch (with the smirk of one about to perform a good action)</p>
<p>for the return of Charlotte: that tooth should be extracted at once. As I</p>
<p>lurched and lunged with the hand mower, bits of grass optically twittering</p>
<p>in the low sun, I kept an eye on that section of suburban street. It curved</p>
<p>in from under an archway of huge shade trees, then sped towards us down,</p>
<p>down, quite sharply, past old Miss Opposite&#x2019;s ivied brick house and</p>
<p>high-sloping lawn (much trimmer than ours) and disappeared behind our own</p>
<p>front porch which I could not see from where I happily belched and labored.</p>
<p>The dandelions perished. A reek of sap mingled with the pineapple. Two</p>
<p>little girls, Marion and Mabel, whose comings and goings I had mechanically</p>
<p>followed of late (but who could replace my Lolita?) went toward the avenue</p>
<p>(from which our Lawn Street cascaded), one pushing a bicycle, the other</p>
<p>feeding from a paper bag, both talking at the top of their sunny voices.</p>
<p>Leslie, old Miss Opposite&#x2019;s gardener and chauffeur, a very amiable and</p>
<p>athletic Negro, grinned at me from afar and shouted, re-shouted, commented</p>
<p>by gesture, that I was mighty energetic today. The fool dog of the</p>
<p>prosperous junk dealer next door ran after a blue car&#x2013;not Charlotte&#x2019;s. The</p>
<p>prettier of the two little girls (Mabel, I think), shorts, halter with</p>
<p>little to halt, bright hair&#x2013;a nymphet, by Pan!&#x2013;ran back down the street</p>
<p>crumpling her paper bag and was hidden from this Green Goat by the frontage</p>
<p>of Mr. And Mrs. Humbert&#x2019;s residence. A station wagon popped out of the leafy</p>
<p>shade of the avenue, dragging some of it on its roof before the shadows</p>
<p>snapped, and swung by at an idiotic pace, the sweatshirted driver</p>
<p>roof-holding with his left hand and the junkman&#x2019;s dog tearing alongside.</p>
<p>There was a smiling pause&#x2013;and then, with a flutter in my breast, I</p>
<p>witnessed the return of the Blue Sedan. I saw it glide downhill and</p>
<p>disappear behind the corner of the house. I had a glimpse of her calm pale</p>
<p>profile. It occurred to me that until she went upstairs she would not know</p>
<p>whether I had gone or not. A minute later, with an expression of great</p>
<p>anguish on her face, she looked down at me from the window of Lo&#x2019;s room. By</p>
<p>sprinting upstairs, I managed to reach that room before she left it.</p>

<p> 18</p>
<p> When the bride is a window and the groom is a widower; when the former</p>
<p>has lived in Our Great Little Town for hardly two years, and the latter for</p>
<p>hardly a month; when Monsieur wants to get the whole damned thing over with</p>
<p>as quickly as possible, and Madame gives in with a tolerant smile; then, my</p>
<p>reader, the wedding is generally a &#x201C;quiet&#x201D; affair. The bride may dispense</p>
<p>with a tiara of orange blossoms securing her finger-tip veil, nor does she</p>
<p>carry a white orchid in a prayer book. The bride&#x2019;s little daughter might</p>
<p>have added to the ceremonies uniting H. and H. a touch of vivid vermeil; but</p>
<p>I knew I would not dare be too tender with cornered Lolita yet, and</p>
<p>therefore agreed it was not worth while tearing the child away from her</p>
<p>beloved Camp Q.</p>
<p> My soi-disant passionate and lonely Charlotte was in everyday</p>
<p>life matter-of-fact and gregarious. Moreover, I discovered that although she</p>
<p>could not control her heart or her cries, she was a woman of principle.</p>
<p>Immediately after she had become more or less my mistress (despite the</p>
<p>stimulants, her &#x201C;nervous, eager ch&#xE8;ri&#x2013;a heroic ch&#xE8;ri!&#x2013;had</p>
<p>some initial trouble, for which, however, he amply compensated her by a</p>
<p>fantastic display of old-world endearments), good Charlotte interviewed me</p>
<p>about my relations with God. I could have answered that on that score my</p>
<p>mind was open; I said, instead&#x2013;paying my tribute to a pious platitude&#x2013;that</p>
<p>I believed in a cosmic spirit. Looking down at her fingernails, she also</p>
<p>asked me had I not in my family a certain strange strain. I countered by</p>
<p>inquiring whether she would still want to marry me if my father&#x2019;s maternal</p>
<p>grandfather had been, say, a Turk. She said it did not matter a bit; but</p>
<p>that, if she ever found out I did not believe in Our Christian God, she</p>
<p>would commit suicide. She said it so solemnly that it gave me the creeps. It</p>
<p>was then I knew she was a woman of principle.</p>
<p> Oh, she was very genteel: she said &#x201C;excuse me&#x201D; whenever a slight burp</p>
<p>interrupted her flowing speech, called an envelope and ahnvelope, and when</p>
<p>talking to her lady-friends referred to me as Mr. Humbert. I thought it</p>
<p>would please her if I entered the community trailing some glamour after me.</p>
<p>On the day of our wedding a little interview with me appeared in the Society</p>
<p>Column of the Ramsdale Journal, with a photograph of Charlotte, one</p>
<p>eyebrow up and a misprint in her name (&#x201C;Hazer&#x201D;). Despite this contretempts,</p>
<p>the publicity warmed the porcelain cockles of her heart&#x2013;and made my rattles</p>
<p>shake with awful glee. by engaging in church work as well as by getting to</p>
<p>know the better mothers of Lo&#x2019;s schoolmates, Charlotte in the course of</p>
<p>twenty months or so had managed to become if not a prominent, at least an</p>
<p>acceptable citizen, but never before had she come under that thrilling</p>
<p>rubrique, and it was I who put her there, Mr. Edgar H. Humbert (I</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (52 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:53file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>threw in the &#x201C;Edgar&#x201D; just for the heck of it), &#x201C;writer and explorer.&#x201D;</p>
<p>McCoo&#x2019;s brother, when taking it down, asked me what I had written. Whatever</p>
<p>I told him came out as &#x201C;several books on Peacock, Rainbow and other poets.&#x201D;</p>
<p>It was also noted that Charlotte and I had known each other for several</p>
<p>years and that I was a distant relation of her first husband. I hinted I had</p>
<p>had an affair with her thirteen years ago but this was not mentioned in</p>
<p>print. To Charlotte I said that society columns should contain a</p>
<p>shimmer of errors.</p>
<p> Let us go on with this curious tale. When called upon to enjoy my</p>
<p>promotion from lodger to lover, did I experience only bitterness and</p>
<p>distaste? No. Mr. Humbert confesses to a certain titillation of his vanity,</p>
<p>to some faint tenderness, even to a pattern of remorse daintily running</p>
<p>along the steel of his conspiratorial dagger. Never had I thought that the</p>
<p>rather ridiculous, through rather handsome Mrs. Haze, with her blind faith</p>
<p>in the wisdom of her church and book club, her mannerisms of elocution, her</p>
<p>harsh, cold, contemptuous attitude toward an adorable, downy-armed child of</p>
<p>twelve, could turn into such a touching, helpless creature as soon as I laid</p>
<p>my hands upon her which happened on the threshold of Lolita&#x2019;s room whither</p>
<p>she tremulously backed repeating &#x201C;no, no, please no.&#x201D;</p>
<p> The transformation improved her looks. Her smile that had been such a</p>
<p>contrived thing, thenceforth became the radiance of utter adoration&#x2013;a</p>
<p>radiance having something soft and moist about it, in which, with wonder, I</p>
<p>recognized a resemblance to the lovely, inane, lost look that Lo had when</p>
<p>gloating over a new kind of concoction at the soda fountain or mutely</p>
<p>admiring my expensive, always tailor-fresh clothes. Deeply fascinated, I</p>
<p>would watch Charlotte while she swapped parental woes with some other lady</p>
<p>and made that national grimace of feminine resignation (eyes rolling up,</p>
<p>mouth drooping sideways) which, in an infantile form, I had seen Lo making</p>
<p>herself. We had highballs before turning in, and with their help, I would</p>
<p>manage to evoke the child while caressing the mother. This was the white</p>
<p>stomach within which my nymphet had been a little curved fish in 1934. This</p>
<p>carefully dyed hair, so sterile to my sense of smell and touch, acquired at</p>
<p>certain lamplit moments in the poster bed the tinge, if not the texture, of</p>
<p>Lolita&#x2019;s curls. I kept telling myself, as I wielded my brand-new</p>
<p>large-as-life wife, that biologically this was the nearest I could get to</p>
<p>Lolita; that at Lolita&#x2019;s age, Lotte had been as desirable a schoolgirl as</p>
<p>her daughter was, and as Lolita&#x2019;s daughter would be some day. I had my wife</p>
<p>unearth from under a collection of shoes (Mr. Haze had a passion for them,</p>
<p>it appears) a thirty-year-old album, so that I might see how Lotte had</p>
<p>looked as a child; and even though the light was wrong and the dresses</p>
<p>graceless, I was able to make out a dim first version of Lolita&#x2019;s outline,</p>
<p>legs, cheekbones, bobbed nose. Lottelita, Lolitchen.</p>
<p> So I tom-peeped across the hedges of years, into wan little windows.</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (53 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:53file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>And when, by means of pitifully ardent, naively lascivious caresses, she of</p>
<p>the noble nipple and massive thigh prepared me for the performance of my</p>
<p>nightly duty, it was still a nymphet&#x2019;s scent that in despair I tried to pick</p>
<p>up, as I bayed through the undergrowth of dark decaying forests.</p>
<p> I simply can&#x2019;t tell you how gentle, how touching my poor wife was. At</p>
<p>breakfast, in the depressingly bright kitchen, with its chrome glitter and</p>
<p>Hardware and Co. Calendar and cute breakfast nook (simulating that Coffee</p>
<p>Shoppe where in their college days Charlotte and Humbert used to coo</p>
<p>together), she would sit, robed in red, her elbow on the plastic-topped</p>
<p>table, her cheek propped on her fist, and stare at me with intolerable</p>
<p>tenderness as I consumed my ham and eggs. Humbert&#x2019;s face might twitch with</p>
<p>neuralgia, but in her eyes it vied in beauty and animation with the sun and</p>
<p>shadows of leaves rippling on the white refrigerator. My solemn exasperation</p>
<p>was to her the silence of love. My small income added to her even smaller</p>
<p>one impressed her as a brilliant fortune; not because the resulting sum now</p>
<p>sufficed for most middle-class needs, but because even my money shone in her</p>
<p>eyes with the magic of my manliness, and she saw our joint account as one of</p>
<p>those southern boulevards at midday that have solid shade on one side and</p>
<p>smooth sunshine on the other, all the way to the end of a prospect, where</p>
<p>pink mountains loom.</p>
<p> Into the fifty days of our cohabitation Charlotte crammed the</p>
<p>activities of as many years. The poor woman busied herself with a number of</p>
<p>things she had foregone long before or had never been much interested in, as</p>
<p>if (to prolong these Proustian intonations) by my marrying the mother of the</p>
<p>child I loved I had enabled my wife to regain an abundance of youth by</p>
<p>proxy. With the zest of a banal young bride, she started to &#x201C;glorify the</p>
<p>home.&#x201D; Knowing as I did its every cranny by heart&#x2013;since those days when</p>
<p>from my chair I mentally mapped out Lolita&#x2019;s course through the house&#x2013;I had</p>
<p>long entered into a sort of emotional relationship with it, with its very</p>
<p>ugliness and dirt, and now I could almost feel the wretched thing cower in</p>
<p>its reluctance to endure the bath of ecru and ocher and putt-buff-and-snuff</p>
<p>that Charlotte planned to give it. She never got as far as that, thank God,</p>
<p>but she did use up a tremendous amount of energy in washing window shades,</p>
<p>waxing the slats of Venetian blinds, purchasing new shades and new blinds,</p>
<p>returning them to the store, replacing them by others, and so on, in a</p>
<p>constant chiaroscuro of smiles and frowns, doubts and pouts. She dabbled in</p>
<p>cretonnes and chintzes; she changed the colors of the sofa&#x2013;the sacred sofa</p>
<p>where a bubble of paradise had once burst in slow motion within me. She</p>
<p>rearranged the furniture&#x2013;and was pleased when she found, in a household</p>
<p>treatise, that &#x201C;it is permissible to separate a pair of sofa commodes and</p>
<p>their companion lamps.&#x201D; With the authoress of Your Home Is You, she</p>
<p>developed a hatred for little lean chairs and spindle tables. She believed</p>
<p>that a room having a generous expanse of glass, and lots of rich wood</p>

<p>paneling was an example of the masculine type of room, whereas the feminine</p>
<p>type was characterized by lighter-looking windows and frailer woodwork. The</p>
<p>novels I had found her reading when I moved in were now replaced by</p>
<p>illustrated catalogues and homemaking guides. From a firm located at 4640</p>
<p>Roosevelt Blvd., Philadelphia, she ordered for our double bed a &#x201C;damask</p>
<p>covered 312 coil mattress&#x201D;&#x2013;although the old one seemed to me resilient and</p>
<p>durable enough for whatever it had to support.</p>
<p> A Midwesterner, as her late husband had also been, she had lived in coy</p>
<p>Ramsdale, the gem of an eastern state, not long enough to know all the nice</p>
<p>people. She knew slightly the jovial dentist who lived in a kind of</p>
<p>ramshackle wooden chateau behind our lawn. She had met at a church tea the</p>
<p>&#x201C;snooty&#x201D; wife of the local junk dealer who owned the &#x201C;colonial&#x201D; white horror</p>
<p>at the corner of the avenue. Now and then she &#x201C;visited with&#x201D; old Miss</p>
<p>Opposite; but the more patrician matrons among those she called upon, or met</p>
<p>at lawn functions, or had telephone chats with&#x2013;such dainty ladies as Mrs.</p>
<p>Glave, Mrs. Sheridan, Mrs. McCrystal, Mrs. Knight and others, seldom seemed</p>
<p>to call on my neglected Charlotte. Indeed, the only couple with whom she had</p>
<p>relations of real cordiality, devoid of any arri&#xF5;re-pens&#xE8;e or</p>
<p>practical foresight, were the Farlows who had just come back from a business</p>
<p>trip to Chile in time to attend our wedding, with the Chatfields, McCoos,</p>
<p>and a few others (but not Mrs. Junk or the even prouder Mrs. Talbot). John</p>
<p>Farlow was a middle-aged, quiet, quietly athletic, quietly successful dealer</p>
<p>in sporting goods, who had an office at Parkington, forty miles away: it was</p>
<p>he who got me the cartridges for that Colt and showed me how to use it,</p>
<p>during a walk in the woods one Sunday; he was also what he called with a</p>
<p>smile a part-time lawyer and had handled some of Charlotte&#x2019;s affairs. Jean,</p>
<p>his youngish wife (and first cousin), was a long-limbed girl in harlequin</p>
<p>glasses with two boxer dogs, two pointed breasts and a big red mouth. She</p>
<p>painted&#x2013;landscapes and portraits&#x2013;and vividly do I remember praising, over</p>
<p>cocktails, the picture she had made of a niece of hers, little Rosaline</p>
<p>Honeck, a rosy honey in a Girl Scout uniform, beret of green worsted, belt</p>
<p>of green webbing, charming shoulder-long curls&#x2013;and John removed his pipe</p>
<p>and said it was a pity Dolly (my Dolita) and Rosaline were so critical of</p>
<p>each other at school, but he hoped, and we all hoped, they would get on</p>
<p>better when they returned from their respective camps. We talked of the</p>
<p>school. It had its drawbacks, and it had its virtues. &#x201C;Of course, too many</p>
<p>of the tradespeople here are Italians,&#x201D; said John, &#x201C;but on the other hand we</p>
<p>are still spared&#x2013;&#x201D; &#x201C;I wish,&#x201D; interrupted Jean with a laugh, &#x201C;Dolly and</p>
<p>Rosaline were spending the summer together.&#x201D; Suddenly I imagined Lo</p>
<p>returning from camp&#x2013;brown, warm, drowsy, drugged&#x2013;and was ready to weep</p>
<p>with passion and impatience.</p>

<p> A few words more about Mrs. Humbert while the going is good (a bad</p>
<p>accident is to happen quite soon). I had been always aware of the possessive</p>
<p>streak in her, but I never thought she would be so crazily jealous of</p>
<p>anything in my life that had not been she. She showed a fierce insatiable</p>
<p>curiosity for my past. She desired me to resuscitate all my loves so that</p>
<p>she might make me insult them, and trample upon them, and revoke them</p>
<p>apostately and totally, thus destroying my past. She made me tell her about</p>
<p>my marriage to Valeria, who was of course a scream; but I also had to</p>
<p>invent, or to pad atrociously, a long series of mistresses for Charlotte&#x2019;s</p>
<p>morbid delectation. To keep her happy, I had to present her with an</p>
<p>illustrated catalogue of them, all nicely differentiated, according to the</p>
<p>rules of those American ads where schoolchildren are pictured in a subtle</p>
<p>ratio of races, with one&#x2013;only one, but as cute as they make</p>
<p>them&#x2013;chocolate-colored round-eyed little lad, almost in the very middle of</p>
<p>the front row. So I presented my women, and had them smile and sway&#x2013;the</p>
<p>languorous blond, the fiery brunette, the sensual copperhead&#x2013;as if on</p>
<p>parade in a bordello. The more popular and platitudinous I made them, the</p>
<p>more Mrs. Humbert was pleased with the show.</p>
<p> Never in my life had I confessed so much or received so many</p>
<p>confessions. The sincerity and artlessness with which she discussed what she</p>
<p>called her &#x201C;love-life,&#x201D; from first necking to connubial catch-as-catch-can,</p>
<p>were, ethically, in striking contrast with my glib compositions, but</p>
<p>technically the two sets were congeneric since both were affected by the</p>
<p>same stuff (soap operas, psychoanalysis and cheap novelettes) upon which I</p>
<p>drew for my characters and she for her mode of expression. I was</p>
<p>considerably amused by certain remarkable sexual habits that the good Harold</p>
<p>Haze had had according to Charlotte who thought my mirth improper; but</p>
<p>otherwise her autobiography was as devoid of interests as her autopsy would</p>
<p>have been. I never saw a healthier woman than she, despite thinning diets.</p>
<p> Of my Lolita she seldom spoke&#x2013;more seldom, in fact, than she did of</p>
<p>the blurred, blond male baby whose photograph to the exclusion of all others</p>
<p>adorned our bleak bedroom. In once of her tasteless reveries, she predicted</p>
<p>that the dead infant&#x2019;s soul would return to earth in the form of the child</p>
<p>she would bear in her present wedlock. And although I felt no special urge</p>
<p>to supply the Humbert line with a replica of Harold&#x2019;s production (Lolita,</p>
<p>with an incestuous thrill, I had grown to regard as my child), it</p>
<p>occurred to me that a prolonged confinement, with a nice Cesarean operation</p>
<p>and other complications in a safe maternity ward sometime next spring, would</p>
<p>give me a chance to be alone with my Lolita for weeks, perhaps&#x2013;and gorge</p>
<p>the limp nymphet with sleeping pills.</p>
<p> Oh, she simply hated her daughter! What I thought especially vicious</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (56 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:53file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>was that she had gone out of her way to answer with great diligence the</p>
<p>questionnaires in a fool&#x2019;s book she had (A guide to Your Child&#x2019;s</p>
<p>Development), published in Chicago. The rigmarole went year by year, and</p>
<p>Mom was supposed to fill out a kind of inventory at each of her child&#x2019;s</p>
<p>birthdays. On Lo&#x2019;s twelfth, January 1, 1947, Charlotte Haze, n&#xE8;e Becker, had</p>
<p>underlined the following epithets, ten out of forty, under &#x201C;Your Child&#x2019;s</p>
<p>Personality&#x201D;: aggressive, boisterous, critical, distrustful, impatient,</p>
<p>irritable, inquisitive, listless, negativistic (underlined twice) and</p>
<p>obstinate. She had ignored the thirty remaining adjectives, among which were</p>
<p>cheerful, co-operative, energetic, and so forth. It was really maddening.</p>
<p>With a brutality that otherwise never appeared in my loving wife&#x2019;s mild</p>
<p>nature, she attacked and routed such of Lo&#x2019;s little belongings that had</p>
<p>wandered to various parts of the house to freeze there like so many</p>
<p>hypnotized bunnies. Little did the good lady dream that one morning when an</p>
<p>upset stomach (the result of my trying to improve on her sauces) had</p>
<p>prevented me from accompanying her to church, I deceived her with one of</p>
<p>Lolita&#x2019;s anklets. And then, her attitude toward my saporous darling&#x2019;s</p>
<p>letters!</p>
<p> &#x201C;Dear Mummy and Hummy,</p>
<p> Hope you are fine. Thank you very much for the candy. I [crossed out</p>
<p>and re-written again] I lost my new sweater in the woods. It has been cold</p>
<p>here for the last few days. I&#x2019;m having a time. Love,</p>
<p> Dolly.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;The dumb child,&#x201D; said Mrs. Humbert, &#x201C;has left out a word before</p>
<p>&#x2018;time.&#x2019; That sweater was all-wool, and I wish you would not send her candy</p>
<p>without consulting me.&#x201D;</p>
<p> 20</p>
<p> There was a woodlake (Hourglass Lake&#x2013;not as I had thought it was</p>
<p>spelled) a few miles from Ramsdale, and there was one week of great heat at</p>
<p>the end of July when we drove there daily. I am now obliged to describe in</p>
<p>some tedious detail our last swim there together, one tropical Tuesday</p>
<p>morning.</p>
<p> We had left the car in a parking area not far from the road and were</p>
<p>making our way down a path cut through the pine forest to the lake, when</p>
<p>Charlotte remarked that Jean Farlow, in quest of rare light effects (Jean</p>
<p>belonged to the old school of painting), had seen Leslie taking a dip &#x201C;in</p>
<p>the ebony&#x201D; (as John had quipped) at five o&#x2019;clock in the morning last Sunday.</p>
<p> &#x201C;The water,&#x201D; I said, &#x201C;must have been quite cold.&#x201D;</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (57 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:53file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p> &#x201C;That is not the point,&#x201D; said the logical doomed dear. &#x201C;He is</p>
<p>subnormal, you see. And,&#x201D; she continued (in that carefully phrased way of</p>
<p>hers that was beginning to tell on my health), &#x201C;I have a very definite</p>
<p>feeling our Louise is in love with that moron.&#x201D;</p>
<p> Feeling. &#x201C;We feel Dolly is not doing as well&#x201D; etc. (from an old school</p>
<p>report).</p>
<p> The Humberts walked on, sandaled and robed.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Do you know, Hum: I have one most ambitious dream,&#x201D; pronounced Lady</p>
<p>Hum, lowering her head&#x2013;shy of that dream&#x2013;and communing with the tawny</p>
<p>ground. &#x201C;I would love to get hold of a real trained servant maid like that</p>
<p>German girl the Talbots spoke of; and have her live in the house.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;No room,&#x201D; I said.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Come,&#x201D; she said with her quizzical smile, &#x201C;surely, ch&#xE8;ri, you</p>
<p>underestimate the possibilities of the Humbert home. We would put her in</p>
<p>Lo&#x2019;s room. I intended to make a guestroom of that hole anyway. It&#x2019;s the</p>
<p>coldest and meanest in the whole house.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;What are you talking about?&#x201D; I asked, the skin of my cheekbones</p>
<p>tensing up (this I take the trouble to note only because my daughter&#x2019;s skin</p>
<p>did the same when she felt that way: disbelief, disgust, irritation).</p>
<p> &#x201C;Are you bothered by Romantic Associations?&#x201D; queried my wife&#x2013;in</p>
<p>allusion to her first surrender.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Hell no,&#x201D; said I. &#x201C;I just wonder where will you put your daughter when</p>
<p>you get your guest or your maid.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Ah,&#x201D; said Mrs. Humbert, dreaming, smiling, drawing out the &#x201C;Ah&#x201D;</p>
<p>simultaneously with the raise of one eyebrow and a soft exhalation of</p>
<p>breath. &#x201C;Little Lo, I&#x2019;m afraid, does not enter the picture at all, at all.</p>
<p>Little Lo goes straight from camp to a good boarding school with strict</p>
<p>discipline and some sound religious training. And then&#x2013;Beardsley College. I</p>
<p>have it all mapped out, you need not worry.&#x201D;</p>
<p> She went on to say that she, Mrs. Humbert, would have to overcome her</p>
<p>habitual sloth and write to Miss Phalli&#x2019;s sister who taught at St. Algebra.</p>
<p>The dazzling lake emerged. I said I had forgotten my sunglasses in the car</p>
<p>and would catch up with her.</p>
<p> I had always thought that wringing one&#x2019;s hands was a fictional</p>
<p>gesture&#x2013;the obscure outcome, perhaps, of some medieval ritual; but as I</p>
<p>took to the woods, for a spell of despair and desperate meditation, this was</p>
<p>the gesture (&#x201C;look, Lord, at these chains!&#x201D;) that would have come nearest to</p>
<p>the mute expression of my mood.</p>
<p> Had Charlotte been Valeria, I would have known how to handle the</p>
<p>situation; and &#x201C;handle&#x201D; is the word I want. In the good old days, by merely</p>
<p>twisting fat Valechka&#x2019;s brittle wrist (the one she had fallen upon from a</p>
<p>bicycle) I could make her change her mind instantly; but anything of the</p>
<p>sort in regard to Charlotte was unthinkable. Bland American Charlotte</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (58 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:53file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>frightened me. My lighthearted dream of controlling her through her passion</p>
<p>for me was all wrong. I dared not do anything to spoil the image of me she</p>
<p>had set up to adore. I had toadied to her when she was the awesome duenna of</p>
<p>my darling, and a groveling something still persisted in my attitude toward</p>
<p>her. The only ace I held was her ignorance of my monstrous love for her Lo.</p>
<p>She had been annoyed by Lo&#x2019;s liking me; but my feelings she could not</p>
<p>divine. To Valeria I might have said: &#x201C;Look here, you fat fool, c&#x2019;est moi</p>
<p>qui d&#xE8;cide what is good for Dolores Humbert.&#x201D; To Charlotte, I could not</p>
<p>even say (with ingratiating calm): &#x201C;Excuse me, my dear, I disagree. Let us</p>
<p>give the child one more chance. Let me be her private tutor for a year or</p>
<p>so. You once told me yourself&#x2013;&#x201D; In fact, I could not say anything at all to</p>
<p>Charlotte about the child without giving myself away. Oh, you cannot imagine</p>
<p>(as I had never imagined) what these women of principle are! Charlotte, who</p>
<p>did not notice the falsity of all the everyday conventions and rules of</p>
<p>behavior, and foods, and books, and people she doted upon, would distinguish</p>
<p>at once a false intonation in anything I might say with a view to keeping Lo</p>
<p>near. She was like a musician who may be an odious vulgarian in ordinary</p>
<p>life, devoid of tact and taste; but who will hear a false note in music with</p>
<p>diabolical accuracy of judgment. To break Charlotte&#x2019;s will, I would have to</p>
<p>break her heart. If I broke her heart, her image of me would break too. If I</p>
<p>said: &#x201C;Either I have my way with Lolita, and you help me to keep the matter</p>
<p>quiet, or we part at once,&#x201D; she would have turned as pale as a woman of</p>
<p>clouded glass and slowly replied: &#x201C;All right, whatever you add or retract,</p>
<p>this is the end.&#x201D; And the end it would be.</p>
<p> Such, then, was the mess. I remember reaching the parking area and</p>
<p>pumping a handful of rust-tasting water, and drinking it as avidly as if it</p>
<p>would give me magic wisdom, youth, freedom, a tiny concubine. For a while,</p>
<p>purple-robed, heel-dangling, I sat on the edge of one of the rude tables,</p>
<p>under the whooshing pines. In the middle distance, two little maidens in</p>
<p>shorts and halters came out of a sun-dappled privy marked &#x201C;Women.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Gum-chewing Mabel (or Mabel&#x2019;s understudy) laboriously, absentmindedly</p>
<p>straddled a bicycle, and Marion, shaking her hair because of the flies,</p>
<p>settled behind, legs wide apart; and wobbling, they slowly, absently, merged</p>
<p>with the light and shade. Lolita! Father and daughter melting into these</p>
<p>woods! The natural solution was to destroy Mrs. Humbert. But how?</p>
<p> No man can bring about the perfect murder; chance, however, can do it.</p>
<p>There was the famous dispatch of a Mme Lacour in Arles, southern France, at</p>
<p>the close of last century. An unidentified bearded six-footer, who, it was</p>
<p>later conjectured, had been the lady&#x2019;s secret lover, walked up to her in a</p>
<p>crowded street, soon after her marriage to Colonel Lacour, and mortally</p>
<p>stabbed her in the back, three times, while the Colonel, a small bulldog of</p>
<p>a man, hung onto the murderer&#x2019;s arm. By a miraculous and beautiful</p>
<p>coincidence, right at the moment when the operator was in the act of</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (59 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:53file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>loosening the angry little husband&#x2019;s jaws (while several onlookers were</p>
<p>closing in upon the group), a cranky Italian in the house nearest to the</p>
<p>scene set off by sheer accident some kind of explosive he was tinkering</p>
<p>with, and immediately the street was turned into a pandemonium of smoke,</p>
<p>falling bricks and running people. The explosion hurt no one (except that it</p>
<p>knocked out game Colonel Lacour); but the lady&#x2019;s vengeful lover ran when the</p>
<p>others ran&#x2013;and lived happily ever after.</p>
<p> Now look what happens when the operator himself plans a perfect</p>
<p>removal.</p>
<p> I walked down to Hourglass Lake. The spot from which we and a few other</p>
<p>&#x201C;nice&#x201D; couples (the Farlows, the Chatfields) bathed was a kind of small</p>
<p>cove; my Charlotte liked it because it was almost &#x201C;a private beach.&#x201D; The</p>
<p>main bathing facilities (or drowning facilities&#x201D; as the Ramsdale</p>
<p>Journal had had occasion to say) were in the left (eastern) part of</p>
<p>the hourglass, and could not be seen from our covelet. To our right, the</p>
<p>pines soon gave way to a curve of marshland which turned again into forest</p>
<p>on the opposite side.</p>
<p> I sat down beside my wife so noiselessly that she started.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Shall we go in?&#x201D; she asked.</p>
<p> &#x201C;We shall in a minute. Let me follow a train of thought.&#x201D;</p>
<p> I thought. More than a minute passed.</p>
<p> &#x201C;All right. Come on.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Was I on that train?&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;You certainly were.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;I hope so,&#x201D; said Charlotte entering the water. It soon reached the</p>
<p>gooseflesh of her thick thighs; and then, joining her outstretched hands,</p>
<p>shutting her mouth tight, very plain-faced in her black rubber headgear,</p>
<p>charlotte flung herself forward with a great splash.</p>
<p> Slowly we swam out into the shimmer of the lake.</p>
<p> On the opposite bank, at least a thousand paces away (if one cold walk</p>
<p>across water), I could make out the tiny figures of two men working like</p>
<p>beavers on their stretch of shore. I knew exactly who they were: a retired</p>
<p>policeman of Polish descent and the retired plumber who owned most of the</p>
<p>timber on that side of the lake. And I also knew they were engaged in</p>
<p>building, just for the dismal fun of the thing, a wharf. The knocks that</p>
<p>reached us seemed so much bigger than what could be distinguished of those</p>
<p>dwarfs&#x2019; arms and tools; indeed, one suspected the director of those</p>
<p>acrosonic effects to have been at odds with the puppet-master, especially</p>
<p>since the hefty crack of each diminutive blow lagged behind its visual</p>
<p>version.</p>
<p> The short white-sand strip of &#x201C;our&#x201D; beach&#x2013;from which by now we had</p>
<p>gone a little way to reach deep water&#x2013;was empty on weekday mornings. There</p>
<p>was nobody around except those two tiny very busy figures on the opposite</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (60 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:53file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>side, and a dark-red private plane that droned overhead, and then</p>
<p>disappeared in the blue. The setting was really perfect for a brisk bubbling</p>
<p>murder, and here was the subtle point: the man of law and the man of water</p>
<p>were just near enough to witness an accident and just far enough not to</p>
<p>observe a crime. They were near enough to hear a distracted bather thrashing</p>
<p>about and bellowing for somebody to come and help him save his drowning</p>
<p>wife; and they were too far to distinguish (if they happened to look too</p>
<p>soon) that the anything but distracted swimmer was finishing to tread his</p>
<p>wife underfoot. I was not yet at that stage; I merely want to convey the</p>
<p>ease of the act, the nicety of the setting! So there was Charlotte swimming</p>
<p>on with dutiful awkwardness (she was a very mediocre mermaid), but not</p>
<p>without a certain solemn pleasure (for was not her merman by her side?); and</p>
<p>as I watched, with the stark lucidity of a future recollection (you</p>
<p>know&#x2013;trying to see things as you will remember having seen them), the</p>
<p>glossy whiteness of her wet face so little tanned despite all her endeavors,</p>
<p>and her pale lips, and her naked convex forehead, and the tight black cap,</p>
<p>and the plump wet neck, I knew that all I had to do was to drop back, take a</p>
<p>deep breath, then grab her by the ankle and rapidly dive with my captive</p>
<p>corpse. I say corpse because surprise, panic and inexperience would cause</p>
<p>her to inhale at once a lethal gallon of lake, while I would be able to hold</p>
<p>on for at least a full minute, open-eyed under water. The fatal gesture</p>
<p>passed like the tail of a falling star across the blackness of the</p>
<p>contemplated crime. It was like some dreadful silent ballet, the male dancer</p>
<p>holding the ballerina by her foot and streaking down through watery</p>
<p>twilight. I might come up for a mouthful of air while still holding her</p>
<p>down, and then would dive again as many times as would be necessary, and</p>
<p>only when the curtain came down on her for good, would I permit myself to</p>
<p>yell for help. And when some twenty minutes later the two puppets steadily</p>
<p>growing arrived in a rowboat, one half newly painted, poor Mrs. Humbert</p>
<p>Humbert, the victim of a cramp or coronary occlusion, or both, would be</p>
<p>standing on her head in the inky ooze, some thirty feet below the smiling</p>
<p>surface of Hourglass Lake.</p>
<p> Simple, was it not? But what d&#x2019;ye know, folks&#x2013;I just could not make</p>
<p>myself do it!</p>
<p> She swam beside me, a trustful and clumsy seal, and all the logic of</p>
<p>passion screamed in my ear: Now is the time! And, folks, I just couldn&#x2019;t! In</p>
<p>silence I turned shoreward and gravely, dutifully, she also turned, and</p>
<p>still hell screamed its counsel, and still I could not make myself drown the</p>
<p>poor, slippery, big-bodied creature. The scream grew more and more remote as</p>
<p>I realized the melancholy fact that neither tomorrow, nor Friday, nor any</p>
<p>other day or night, could I make myself put her to death. Oh, I could</p>
<p>visualize myself slapping Valeria&#x2019;s breasts out of alignment, or otherwise</p>
<p>hurting her&#x2013;and I could see myself, no less clearly, shooting her lover in</p>

<p>the underbelly and making him say &#x201C;akh!&#x201D; and sit down. But I could not kill</p>
<p>Charlotte&#x2013;especially when things were on the whole not quite as hopeless,</p>
<p>perhaps, as they seemed at first wince on that miserable morning. Were I to</p>
<p>catch her by her strong kicking foot; were I to see her amazed look, hear</p>
<p>her awful voice; were I still to go through with the ordeal, her ghost would</p>
<p>haunt me all my life. Perhaps if the year were 1447 instead of 1947 I might</p>
<p>have hoodwinked my gentle nature by administering her some classical poison</p>
<p>from a hollow agate, some tender philter of death. But in our middle-class</p>
<p>nosy era it would not have come off the way it used to in the brocaded</p>
<p>palaces of the past. Nowadays you have to be a scientist if you want to be a</p>
<p>killer. No, no, I was neither. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the</p>
<p>majority of sex offenders that hanker for some throbbing, sweet-moaning,</p>
<p>physical but not necessarily coital, relation with a girl-child, are</p>
<p>innocuous, inadequate, passive, timid strangers who merely ask the community</p>
<p>to allow them to pursue their practically harmless, so-called aberrant</p>
<p>behavior, their little hot wet private acts of sexual deviation without the</p>
<p>police and society cracking down upon them. We are not sex fiends! We do not</p>
<p>rape as good soldiers do. We are unhappy, mild, dog-eyed gentlemen,</p>
<p>sufficiently well integrated to control our urge in the presence of adults,</p>
<p>but ready to give years and years of life for one chance to touch a nymphet.</p>
<p>Emphatically, no killers are we. Poets never kill. Oh, my poor Charlotte, do</p>
<p>not hate me in your eternal heaven among an eternal alchemy of asphalt and</p>
<p>rubber and metal and stone&#x2013;but thank God, not water, not water!</p>
<p> Nonetheless it was a very close shave, speaking quite objectively. And</p>
<p>now comes the point of my perfect-crime parable.</p>
<p> We sat down on our towels in the thirsty sun. She looked around,</p>
<p>loosened her bra, and turned over on her stomach to give her back a chance</p>
<p>to be feasted upon. She said she loved me. She sighed deeply. She extended</p>
<p>one arm and groped in the pocket of her robe for her cigarettes. She sat up</p>
<p>and smoked. She examined her right shoulder. She kissed me heavily with open</p>
<p>smoky mouth. Suddenly, down the sand bank behind us, from under the bushes</p>
<p>and pines, a stone rolled, then another.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Those disgusting prying kids,&#x201D; said Charlotte, holding up her big bra</p>
<p>to her breast and turning prone again. &#x201C;I shall have to speak about that to</p>
<p>Peter Krestovski.&#x201D;</p>
<p> From the debouchment of the trail came a rustle, a footfall, and Jean</p>
<p>Farlow marched down with her easel and things.</p>
<p> &#x201C;You scared us,&#x201D; said Charlotte.</p>
<p> Jean said she had been up there, in a place of green concealment,</p>
<p>spying on nature (spies are generally shot), trying to finish a lakescape,</p>
<p>but it was no good, she had no talent whatever (which was quite true)&#x2013;&#x201D;And</p>
<p>have you ever tried painting, Humbert?&#x201D; Charlotte, who was a little</p>
<p>jealous of Jean, wanted to know if John was coming.</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (62 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:53file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p> He was. He was coming home for lunch today. He had dropped her on the</p>
<p>way to Parkington and should be picking her up any time now. It was a grand</p>
<p>morning. She always felt a traitor to Cavall and Melampus for leaving them</p>
<p>roped on such gorgeous days. She sat down on the white sand between</p>
<p>Charlotte and me. She wore shorts. Her long brown legs were about as</p>
<p>attractive to me as those of a chestnut mare. She showed her gums when she</p>
<p>smiled.</p>
<p> &#x201C;I almost put both of you into my lake,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;I even noticed</p>
<p>something you overlooked. You [addressing Humbert] had your wrist watch on</p>
<p>in, yes, sir, you had.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Waterproof,&#x201D; said Charlotte softly, making a fish mouth.</p>
<p> Jean took my wrist upon her knee and examined Charlotte&#x2019;s gift, then</p>
<p>put back Humbert&#x2019;s hand on the sand, palm up.</p>
<p> &#x201C;You could see anything that way,&#x201D; remarked Charlotte coquettishly.</p>
<p> Jean sighed. &#x201C;I once saw,&#x201D; she said, &#x201C;two children, male and female, at</p>
<p>sunset, right here, making love. Their shadows were giants. And I told you</p>
<p>about Mr. Tomson at daybreak. Next time I expect to see fat old Ivor in the</p>
<p>ivory. He is really a freak, that man. Last time he told me a completely</p>
<p>indecent story about his nephew. It appears&#x2013;&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Hullo there,&#x201D; said John&#x2019;s voice.</p>
<p> 21</p>
<p> My habit of being silent when displeased or, more exactly, the cold and</p>
<p>scaly quality of my displeased silence, used to frighten Valeria out of her</p>
<p>wits. She used to whimper and wail, saying &#x201C;Ce qui me rend folle, c&#x2019;est</p>
<p>que je ne sais &#xFE; quoi tu penses quand tu es comme &#xE3;a.&#x201D; I tried being</p>
<p>silent with Charlotte&#x2013;and she just chirped on, or chucked my silence under</p>
<p>the chin. An astonishing woman! I would retire to my former room, now a</p>
<p>regular &#x201C;studio,&#x201D; mumbling I had after all a learned opus to write, and</p>
<p>cheerfully Charlotte went on beautifying the home, warbling on the telephone</p>
<p>and writing letters. From my window, through the lacquered shiver of poplar</p>
<p>leaves, I could see her crossing the street and contentedly mailing her</p>
<p>letter to Miss Phalen&#x2019;s sister.</p>
<p> The week of scattered showers and shadows which elapsed after our last</p>
<p>visit to the motionless sands of Hourglass Lake was one of the gloomiest I</p>
<p>can recall. Then came two or three dim rays of hope&#x2013;before the ultimate</p>
<p>sunburst.</p>
<p> It occurred to me that I had a fine brain in beautiful working order</p>
<p>and that I might as well use it. If I dared not meddle with my wife&#x2019;s plans</p>
<p>for her daughter (getting warmer and browner every day in the fair weather</p>
<p>of hopeless distance), I could surely devise some general means to assert</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (63 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:53file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>myself in a general way that might be later directed toward a particular</p>
<p>occasion. One evening, Charlotte herself provided me with an opening.</p>
<p> &#x201C;I have a surprise for you,&#x201D; she said looking at me with fond eyes over</p>
<p>a spoonful of soup. &#x201C;In the fall we two are going to England.&#x201D;</p>
<p> I swallowed my spoonful, wiped my lips with pink paper (Oh, the</p>
<p>cool rich linens of Mirana Hotel!) and said:</p>
<p> &#x201C;I have also a surprise for you, my dear. We two are not going to</p>
<p>England.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Why, what&#x2019;s the matter?&#x201D; she said, looking&#x2013;with more surprise than I</p>
<p>had counted upon&#x2013;at my hands (I was involuntarily folding and tearing and</p>
<p>crushing and tearing again the innocent pink napkin). My smiling face set</p>
<p>her somewhat at ease, however.</p>
<p> &#x201C;The matter is quite simple,&#x201D; I replied. &#x201C;Even in the most harmonious</p>
<p>of households, as ours is, not all decisions are taken by the female</p>
<p>partner. There are certain things that the husband is there to decide. I can</p>
<p>well imagine the thrill that you, a healthy American gal, must experience at</p>
<p>crossing the Atlantic on the same ocean liner with Lady Bumble&#x2013;or Sam</p>
<p>Bumble, the Frozen Meat King, or a Hollywood harlot. And I doubt not that</p>
<p>you and I would make a pretty ad for the Traveling Agency when portrayed</p>
<p>looking&#x2013;you, frankly starry-eyed, I, controlling my envious admiration&#x2013;at</p>
<p>the Palace Sentries, or Scarlet Guards, or Beaver Eaters, or whatever they</p>
<p>are called. But I happen to be allergic to Europe, including merry old</p>
<p>England. As you well know, I have nothing but very sad associations with the</p>
<p>Old and rotting World. No colored ads in your magazines will change the</p>
<p>situation.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;My darling,&#x201D; said Charlotte. &#x201C;I really&#x2013;&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;No, wait a minute. The present matter is only incidental. I am</p>
<p>concerned with a general trend. When you wanted me to spend my afternoons</p>
<p>sunbathing on the Lake instead of doing my work, I gladly gave in and became</p>
<p>a bronzed glamour boy for your sake, instead of remaining a scholar and,</p>
<p>well, an educator. When you lead me to bridge and bourbon with the charming</p>
<p>Farlows, I meekly follow. No, please, wait. When you decorate your home, I</p>
<p>do not interfere with your schemes. When you decide&#x2013;when you decide all</p>
<p>kinds of matters, I may be in complete, or in partial, let us say,</p>
<p>disagreement&#x2013;but I say nothing. I ignore the particular. I cannot ignore</p>
<p>the general. I love being bossed by you, but every game has its rules. I am</p>
<p>not cross. I am not cross at all. Don&#x2019;t do that. But I am one half of this</p>
<p>household, and have a small but distinct voice.&#x201D;</p>
<p> She had come to my side and had fallen on her knees and was slowly, but</p>
<p>very vehemently, shaking her head and clawing at my trousers. She said she</p>
<p>had never realized. She said I was her ruler and her god. She said Louise</p>
<p>had gone, and let us make love right away. She said I must forgive her or</p>
<p>she would die.</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (64 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:53file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p> This little incident filled me with considerable elation. I told her</p>
<p>quietly that it was a matter not of asking forgiveness, but of changing</p>
<p>one&#x2019;s ways; and I resolved to press my advantage and spend a good deal of</p>
<p>time, aloof and moody, working at my book&#x2013;or at least pretending to work.</p>
<p> The &#x201C;studio bed&#x201D; in my former room had long been converted into the</p>
<p>sofa it had always been at heart, and Charlotte had warned me since the very</p>
<p>beginning of our cohabitation that gradually the room would be turned into a</p>
<p>regular &#x201C;writer&#x2019;s den.&#x201D; A couple of days after the British Incident, I was</p>
<p>sitting in a new and very comfortable easy chair, with a large volume in my</p>
<p>lap, when Charlotte rapped with her ring finger and sauntered in. How</p>
<p>different were her movements from those of my Lolita, when she used</p>
<p>to visit me in her dear dirty blue jeans, smelling of orchards in</p>
<p>nymphetland; awkward and fey, and dimly depraved, the lower buttons of her</p>
<p>shirt unfastened. Let me tell you, however, something. Behind the brashness</p>
<p>of little Haze, and the poise of big Haze, a trickle of shy life ran that</p>
<p>tasted the same, that murmured the same. A great French doctor once told my</p>
<p>father that in near relatives the faintest gastric gurgle has the same</p>
<p>&#x201C;voice.&#x201D;</p>
<p> So Charlotte sauntered in. She felt all was not well between us. I had</p>
<p>pretended to fall asleep the night before, and the night before that, as</p>
<p>soon as we had gone to bed, and had risen at dawn.</p>
<p> Tenderly, she inquired if she were not &#x201C;interrupting.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Not at the moment,&#x201D; I said, turning volume C of the Girls&#x2019;</p>
<p>Encyclopedia around to examine a picture printed &#x201C;bottom-edge&#x201D; as</p>
<p>printers say.</p>
<p> Charlotte went up to a little table of imitation mahogany with a</p>
<p>drawer. She put her hand upon it. The little table was ugly, no doubt, but</p>
<p>it had done nothing to her.</p>
<p> &#x201C;I have always wanted to ask you,&#x201D; she said (businesslike, not</p>
<p>coquettish), &#x201C;why is this thing locked up? Do you want it in this room? It&#x2019;s</p>
<p>so abominably uncouth.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Leave it alone,&#x201D; I said. I was Camping in Scandinavia.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Is there a key?&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Hidden.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Oh, Hum . . . &#x201C;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Locked up love letters.&#x201D;</p>
<p> She gave me one of those wounded-doe looks that irritated me so much,</p>
<p>and then, not quite knowing if I was serious, or how to keep up the</p>
<p>conversation, stood for several slow pages (Campus, Canada, Candid Camera,</p>
<p>Candy) peering at the window pane rather than through it, drumming upon it</p>
<p>with sharp almond-and-rose fingernails.</p>
<p> Presently (at Canoeing or Canvasback) she strolled up to my chair and</p>
<p>sank down, tweedily, weightily, on its arm, inundating me with the perfume</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (65 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:53file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>my first wife had used. &#x201C;Would his lordship like to spend the fall</p>
<p>here?&#x201D; she asked, pointing with her little finger at an autumn view</p>
<p>in a conservative Eastern State. &#x201C;Why?&#x201D; (very distinctly and slowly). She</p>
<p>shrugged. (Probably Harold used to take a vacation at that time. Open</p>
<p>season. Conditional reflex on her part.)</p>
<p> &#x201C;I think I know where that is,&#x201D; she said, still pointing. &#x201C;There is a</p>
<p>hotel I remember, Enchanted Hunters, quaint, isn&#x2019;t it? And the food is a</p>
<p>dream. And nobody bothers anybody.&#x201D;</p>
<p> She rubbed her cheek against my temple. Valeria soon got over that.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Is there anything special you would like for dinner, dear? John and</p>
<p>Jean will drop in later.&#x201D;</p>
<p> I answered with a grunt. She kissed me on my underlip, and, brightly</p>
<p>saying she would bake a cake (a tradition subsisted from my lodging days</p>
<p>that I adored her cakes), left me to my idleness.</p>
<p> Carefully putting down the open book where she had sat (it attempted to</p>
<p>send forth a rotation of waves, but an inserted pencil stopped the pages), I</p>
<p>checked the hiding place of the key: rather self-consciously it lay under</p>
<p>the old expensive safety razor I had used before she bought me a much better</p>
<p>and cheaper one. Was it the perfect hiding place&#x2013;there, under the razor, in</p>
<p>the groove of its velvet-lined case? The case lay in a small trunk where I</p>
<p>kept various business papers. Could I improve upon this? Remarkable how</p>
<p>difficult it is to conceal things&#x2013;especially when one&#x2019;s wife keeps</p>
<p>monkeying with the furniture.</p>
<p> 22</p>
<p> I think it was exactly a week after our last swim that the noon mail</p>
<p>brought a reply from the second Miss Phalen. The lady wrote she had just</p>
<p>returned to St. Algebra from her sister&#x2019;s funeral. &#x201C;Euphemia had never been</p>
<p>the same after breaking that hip.&#x201D; As to the matter of Mrs. Humbert&#x2019;s</p>
<p>daughter, she wished to report that it was too late to enroll her this year;</p>
<p>but that she, the surviving Phalen, was practically certain that if Mr. and</p>
<p>Mrs. Humbert brought Dolores over in January, her admittance might be</p>
<p>arranged.</p>
<p> Next day, after lunch, I went to see &#x201C;our&#x201D; doctor, a friendly fellow</p>
<p>whose perfect bedside manner and complete reliance on a few patented drugs</p>
<p>adequately masked his ignorance of, and indifference to, medical science.</p>
<p>The fact that Lo would have to come back to Ramsdale was a treasure of</p>
<p>anticipation. For this event I wanted to be fully prepared. I had in fact</p>
<p>begun my campaign earlier, before Charlotte made that cruel decision of</p>
<p>hers. I had to be sure when my lovely child arrived, that very night, and</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (66 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:53file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>then night after night, until St. Algebra took her away from me, I would</p>
<p>possess the means of putting two creatures to sleep so thoroughly that</p>
<p>neither sound nor touch should rouse them. Throughout most of July I had</p>
<p>been experimenting with various sleeping powders, trying them out on</p>
<p>Charlotte, a great taker of pills. The last dose I had given her (she</p>
<p>thought it was a tablet of mild bromides&#x2013;to anoint her nerves) had knocked</p>
<p>her out for four solid hours. I had put the radio at full blast. I had</p>
<p>blazed in her face an olisbos-like flashlight. I had pushed her, pinched</p>
<p>her, prodded her&#x2013;and nothing had disturbed the rhythm of her calm and</p>
<p>powerful breathing. However, when I had done such a simple thing as kiss</p>
<p>her, she had awakened at once, as fresh and strong as an octopus (I barely</p>
<p>escaped). This would not do, I thought; had to get something still safer. At</p>
<p>first, Dr. Byron did not seem to believe me when I said his last</p>
<p>prescription was no match for my insomnia. He suggested I try again, and for</p>
<p>a moment diverted my attention by showing me photographs of his family. He</p>
<p>had a fascinating child of Dolly&#x2019;s age; but I saw through his tricks and</p>
<p>insisted he prescribe the mightiest pill extant. He suggested I play golf,</p>
<p>but finally agreed to give me something that, he said, &#x201C;would really work&#x201D;;</p>
<p>and going to a cabinet, he produced a vial of violet-blue capsules banded</p>
<p>with dark purple at one end, which, he said, had just been placed on the</p>
<p>market and were intended not for neurotics whom a draft of water could calm</p>
<p>if properly administered, but only for great sleepless artists who had to</p>
<p>die for a few hours in order to live for centuries. I love to fool doctors,</p>
<p>and though inwardly rejoicing, pocketed the pills with a skeptical shrug.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I had had to be careful with him. Once, in another connection,</p>
<p>a stupid lapse on my part made me mention my last sanatorium, and I thought</p>
<p>I saw the tips of his ears twitch. Being not at all keen for Charlotte or</p>
<p>anybody else to know that period of my past, I had hastily explained that I</p>
<p>had once done some research among the insane for a novel. But no matter; the</p>
<p>old rogue certainly had a sweet girleen.</p>
<p> I left in great spirits. Steering my wife&#x2019;s car with one finger, I</p>
<p>contentedly rolled homeward. Ramsdale had, after all, lots of charm. The</p>
<p>cicadas whirred; the avenue had been freshly watered. Smoothly, almost</p>
<p>silkily, I turned down into our steep little street. Everything was somehow</p>
<p>so right that day. So blue and green. I knew the sun shone because my</p>
<p>ignition key was reflected in the windshield; and I knew it was exactly half</p>
<p>past three because the nurse who came to massage Miss Opposite every</p>
<p>afternoon was tripping down the narrow sidewalk in her white stockings and</p>
<p>shoes. As usual, Junk&#x2019;s hysterical setter attacked me as I rolled downhill,</p>
<p>and as usual, the local paper was lying on the porch where it had just been</p>
<p>hurled by Kenny.</p>
<p> The day before I had ended the regime of aloofness I had imposed upon</p>
<p>myself, and now uttered a cheerful homecoming call as I opened the door of</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (67 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:53file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>the living room. With her ream-white nape and bronze bun to me, wearing the</p>
<p>yellow blouse and maroon slacks she had on when I first met her, Charlotte</p>
<p>sat at the corner bureau writing a letter. My hand still on the doorknob, I</p>
<p>repeated my hearty cry. Her writing hand stopped. She sat still for a</p>
<p>moment; then she slowly turned in her chair and rested her elbow on its</p>
<p>curved back. Her face, disfigured by her emotion, was not a pretty sight as</p>
<p>she stared at my legs and said:</p>
<p> &#x201C;The Haze woman, the big bitch, the old cat, the obnoxious mamma,</p>
<p>the&#x2013;the old stupid Haze is no longer your dupe. She has&#x2013;she has . . .&#x201D;</p>
<p> My fair accuser stopped, swallowing her venom and her tears. Whatever</p>
<p>Humbert Humbert said&#x2013;or attempted to say&#x2013;is inessential. She went on:</p>
<p> &#x201C;You&#x2019;re a monster. You&#x2019;re a detestable, abominable, criminal fraud. If</p>
<p>you come near&#x2013;I&#x2019;ll scream out the window. Get back!&#x201D;</p>
<p> Again, whatever H.H. murmured may be omitted, I think.</p>
<p> &#x201C;I am leaving tonight. This is all yours. Only you&#x2019;ll never, never see</p>
<p>that miserable brat again. Get out of this room.&#x201D;</p>
<p> Reader, I did. I went up to the ex-semi-studio. Arms akimbo, I stood</p>
<p>for a moment quite still and self-composed, surveying from the threshold the</p>
<p>raped little table with its open drawer, a key hanging from the lock, four</p>
<p>other household keys on the table top. I walked across the landing into the</p>
<p>Humberts&#x2019; bedroom, and calmly removed my diary from under her pillow into my</p>
<p>pocket. Then I started to walk downstairs, but stopped half-way: she was</p>
<p>talking on the telephone which happened to be plugged just outside the door</p>
<p>of the living room. I wanted to hear what she was saying: she canceled an</p>
<p>order for something or other, and returned to the parlor. I rearranged my</p>
<p>respiration and went through the hallway to the kitchen. There, I opened a</p>
<p>bottle of Scotch. She could never resist Scotch. Then I walked into the</p>
<p>dining room and from there, through the half-open door, contemplated</p>
<p>Charlotte&#x2019;s broad back.</p>
<p> &#x201C;You are ruining my life and yours,&#x201D; I said quietly. &#x201C;Let us be</p>
<p>civilized people. It is all your hallucination. You are crazy, Charlotte.</p>
<p>The notes you found were fragments of a novel. Your name and hers were put</p>
<p>in by mere chance. Just because they came handy. Think it over. I shall</p>
<p>bring you a drink.&#x201D;</p>
<p> She neither answered nor turned, but went on writing in a scorching</p>
<p>scrawl whatever she was writing. A third letter, presumably (two in stamped</p>
<p>envelopes were already laid out on the desk). I went back to the kitchen.</p>
<p> I set out two glasses (to St. Algebra? to Lo?) and opened the</p>
<p>refrigerator. It roared at me viciously while I removed the ice from its</p>
<p>heart. Rewrite. Let her read it again. She will not recall details. Change,</p>
<p>forge. Write a fragment and show it to her or leave it lying around. Why do</p>
<p>faucets sometimes whine so horribly? A horrible situation, really. The</p>
<p>little pillow-shaped blocks of ice&#x2013;pillows for polar teddy bear,</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (68 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:53file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>Lo&#x2013;emitted rasping, crackling, tortured sounds as the warm water loosened</p>
<p>them in their cells. I bumped down the glasses side by side. I poured in the</p>
<p>whiskey and a dram of soda. She had tabooed my pin. Bark and bang went the</p>
<p>icebox. Carrying the glasses, I walked through the dining room and spoke</p>
<p>through the parlor door which was a fraction ajar, not quite space enough</p>
<p>for my elbow.</p>
<p> &#x201C;I have made you a drink,&#x201D; I said.</p>
<p> She did not answer, the mad bitch, and I placed the glasses on the</p>
<p>sideboard near the telephone, which had started to ring.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Leslie speaking. Leslie Tomson,&#x201D; said Leslie Tomson who favored a dip</p>
<p>at dawn. &#x201C;Mrs. Humbert, sir, has been run over and you&#x2019;d better come quick.&#x201D;</p>
<p> I answered, perhaps a bit testily, that my wife was safe and sound, and</p>
<p>still holding the receiver, I pushed open the door and said:</p>
<p> &#x201C;There&#x2019;s this man saying you&#x2019;ve been killed, Charlotte.&#x201D;</p>
<p> But there was no Charlotte in the living room.</p>
<p> 23</p>
<p> I rushed out. The far side of our steep little street presented a</p>
<p>peculiar sight. A big black glossy Packard had climbed Miss Opposite&#x2019;s</p>
<p>sloping lawn at an angle from the sidewalk (where a tartan laprobe had</p>
<p>dropped in a heap), and stood there, shining in the sun, its doors open like</p>
<p>wings, its front wheels deep in evergreen shrubbery. To the anatomical right</p>
<p>of this car, on the trim turn of the lawn-slope, an old gentleman with a</p>
<p>white mustache, well-dressed&#x2013;double-breasted gray suit, polka-dotted</p>
<p>bow-tie&#x2013;lay supine, his long legs together, like a death-size wax figure. I</p>
<p>have to put the impact of an instantaneous vision into a sequence of words;</p>
<p>their physical accumulation in the page impairs the actual flash, the sharp</p>
<p>unity of impression: Rug-heap, car, old man-doll, Miss O.&#x2019;s nurse running</p>
<p>with a rustle, a half-empty tumbler in her hand, back to the screened</p>
<p>porch&#x2013;where the propped-up, imprisoned, decrepit lady herself may be</p>
<p>imagined screeching, but not loud enough to drown the rhythmical yaps of the</p>
<p>Junk setter walking from group to group&#x2013;from a bunch of neighbors already</p>
<p>collected on the sidewalk, near the bit of checked stuff, and back to the</p>
<p>car which he had finally run to earth, and then to another group on the</p>
<p>lawn, consisting of Leslie, two policemen and a sturdy man with tortoise</p>
<p>shell glasses. At this point, I should explain that the prompt appearance of</p>
<p>the patrolmen, hardly more than a minute after the accident, was due to</p>
<p>their having been ticketing the illegally parked cars in a cross lane two</p>
<p>blocks down the grade; that the fellow with the glasses was Frederick Beale,</p>
<p>Jr., driver of the Packard; that his 79-year-old father, whom the nurse had</p>
<p>just watered on the green bank where he lay&#x2013;a banked banker so to</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (69 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:53file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>speak&#x2013;was not in a dead faint, but was comfortably and methodically</p>
<p>recovering from a mild heart attack or its possibility; and, finally, that</p>
<p>the laprobe on the sidewalk (where she had so often pointed out to me with</p>
<p>disapproval the crooked green cracks) concealed the mangled remains of</p>
<p>Charlotte Humbert who had been knocked down and dragged several feet by the</p>
<p>Beale car as she was hurrying across the street to drop three letters in the</p>
<p>mailbox, at the corner of Miss Opposite&#x2019;s lawn. These were picked up and</p>
<p>handed to me by a pretty child in a dirty pink frock, and I got rid of them</p>
<p>by clawing them to fragments in my trouser pocket.</p>
<p> Three doctors and the Farlows presently arrived on the scene and took</p>
<p>over. The widower, a man of exceptional self-control, neither wept nor</p>
<p>raved. He staggered a bit, that he did; but he opened his mouth only to</p>
<p>impart such information or issue such directions as were strictly necessary</p>
<p>in connection with the identification, examination and disposal of a dead</p>
<p>woman, the top of her head a porridge of bone, brains, bronze hair and</p>
<p>blood. The sun was still a blinding red when he was put to bed in Dolly&#x2019;s</p>
<p>room by his two friends, gentle John and dewy-eyed Jean; who, to be near,</p>
<p>retired to the Humberts&#x2019; bedroom for the night; which, for all I know, they</p>
<p>may not have spent as innocently as the solemnity of the occasion required.</p>
<p> I have no reason to dwell, in this very special memoir, on the</p>
<p>pre-funeral formalities that had to be attended to, or on the funeral</p>
<p>itself, which was as quiet as the marriage had been. But a few incidents</p>
<p>pertaining to those four or five days after Charlotte&#x2019;s simple death, have</p>
<p>to be noted.</p>
<p> My first night of widowhood I was so drunk that I slept as soundly as</p>
<p>the child who had slept in that bed. Next morning I hastened to inspect the</p>
<p>fragments of letters in my pocket. They had got too thoroughly mixed up to</p>
<p>be sorted into three complete sets. I assumed that &#x201C;. . . and you had better</p>
<p>find it because I cannot buy . . . &#x201C; came from a letter to Lo; and other</p>
<p>fragments seemed to point to Charlotte&#x2019;s intention of fleeing with Lo to</p>
<p>Parkington, or even back to Pisky, lest the vulture snatch her precious</p>
<p>lamb. Other tatters and shreds (never had I thought I had such strong</p>
<p>talons) obviously referred to an application not to St. A. but to another</p>
<p>boarding school which was said to be so harsh and gray and gaunt in its</p>
<p>methods (although supplying croquet under the elms) as to have earned the</p>
<p>nickname of &#x201C;Reformatory for Young Ladies.&#x201D; Finally, the third epistle was</p>
<p>obviously addressed to me. I made out such items as &#x201C;. . . after a year of</p>
<p>separation we may . . . &#x201C; &#x201C;. . . oh, my dearest, oh my . . . &#x201C; &#x201C;. . . worse</p>
<p>than if it had been a woman you kept . . .&#x201D; &#x201C;. . . or, maybe, I shall die .</p>
<p>. .&#x201D; But on the whole my gleanings made little sense; the various fragments</p>
<p>of those three hasty missives were as jumbled in the palms of my hands as</p>
<p>their elements had been in poor Charlotte&#x2019;s head.</p>
<p> That day John had to see a customer, and Jean had to feed her dogs, and</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (70 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:53file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>so I was to be deprived temporarily of my friends&#x2019; company. The dear people</p>
<p>were afraid I might commit suicide if left alone, and since no other friends</p>
<p>were available (Miss Opposite was incommunicado, the McCoos were busy</p>
<p>building a new house miles away, and the Chatfields had been recently called</p>
<p>to Maine by some family trouble of their own), Leslie and Louise were</p>
<p>commissioned to keep me company under the pretense of helping me to sort out</p>
<p>and pack a multitude of orphaned things. In a moment of superb inspiration I</p>
<p>showed the kind and credulous Farlows (we were waiting for Leslie to come</p>
<p>for his paid tryst with Louise) a little photograph of Charlotte I had found</p>
<p>among her affairs. From a boulder she smiled through blown hair. It had been</p>
<p>taken in April 1934, a memorable spring. While on a business visit to the</p>
<p>States, I had had occasion to spend several months in Pisky. We met&#x2013;and had</p>
<p>a mad love affair. I was married, alas, and she was engaged to Haze, but</p>
<p>after I returned to Europe, we corresponded through a friend, now dead. Jean</p>
<p>whispered she had heard some rumors and looked at the snapshot, and, still</p>
<p>looking, handed it to John, and John removed his pipe and looked at lovely</p>
<p>and fast Charlotte Becker, and handed it back to me. Then they left for a</p>
<p>few hours. Happy Louise was gurgling and scolding her swain in the basement.</p>
<p> Hardly had the Farlows gone than a blue-chinned cleric called&#x2013;and I</p>
<p>tried to make the interview as brief as was consistent with neither hurting</p>
<p>his feelings nor arousing his doubts. Yes, I would devote all my life to the</p>
<p>child&#x2019;s welfare. Here, incidentally, was a little cross that Charlotte</p>
<p>Becker had given me when we were both young. I had a female cousin, a</p>
<p>respectable spinster in New York. There we would find a good private school</p>
<p>for Dolly. Oh, what a crafty Humbert!</p>
<p> For the benefit of Leslie and Louise who might (and did) report it to</p>
<p>John and Jean I made a tremendously loud and beautifully enacted</p>
<p>long-distance call and simulated a conversation with Shirley Holmes. When</p>
<p>John and Jean returned, I completely took them in by telling them, in a</p>
<p>deliberately wild and confused mutter, that Lo had gone with the</p>
<p>intermediate group on a five-day hike and could not be reached.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Good Lord,&#x201D; said Jean, &#x201C;what shall we do?&#x201D;</p>
<p> John said it was perfectly simple&#x2013;he would get the Climax police to</p>
<p>find the hikers&#x2013;it would not take them an hour. In fact, he knew the</p>
<p>country and&#x2013;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Look,&#x201D; he continued, &#x201C;why don&#x2019; I drive there right now, and you may</p>
<p>sleep with Jean&#x201D;&#x2013;(he did not really add that but Jean supported his offer</p>
<p>so passionately that it might be implied).</p>
<p> I broke down. I pleaded with John to let things remain the way they</p>
<p>were. I said I could not bear to have the child all around me, sobbing,</p>
<p>clinging to me, she was so high-strung, the experience might react on her</p>
<p>future, psychiatrists have analyzed such cases. There was a sudden pause.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Well, you are the doctor,&#x201D; said John a little bluntly. &#x201C;But after all</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (71 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:53file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>I was Charlotte&#x2019;s friend and adviser. One would like to know what you are</p>
<p>going to do about the child anyway.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;John,&#x201D; cried Jean, &#x201C;she is his child, not Harold Haze&#x2019;s. Don&#x2019;t you</p>
<p>understand? Humbert is Dolly&#x2019;s real father.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;I see,&#x201D; said John. &#x201C;I am sorry. Yes. I see. I did not realize that. It</p>
<p>simplifies matters, of course. And whatever you feel is right.&#x201D;</p>
<p> The distraught father went on to say he would go and fetch his delicate</p>
<p>daughter immediately after the funeral, and would do his best to give her a</p>
<p>good time in totally different surroundings, perhaps a trip to New Mexico or</p>
<p>California&#x2013;granted, of course, he lived.</p>
<p> So artistically did I impersonate the calm of ultimate despair, the</p>
<p>hush before some crazy outburst, that the perfect Farlows removed me to</p>
<p>their house. They had a good cellar, as cellars go in this country; and that</p>
<p>was helpful, for I feared insomnia and a ghost.</p>
<p> Now I must explain my reasons for keeping Dolores away.</p>
<p>Naturally, at first, when Charlotte had just been eliminated and I</p>
<p>re-entered the house a free father, and gulped down the two</p>
<p>whiskey-and-sodas I had prepared, and topped them with a pint or two of my</p>
<p>&#x201C;pin,&#x201D; and went to the bathroom to get away from neighbors and friends,</p>
<p>there was but one thing in my mind and pulse&#x2013;namely, the awareness that a</p>
<p>few hours hence, warm, brown&#x2013;haired, and mine, mine, mine, Lolita would be</p>
<p>in my arms, shedding tears that I would kiss away faster than they could</p>
<p>well. But as I stood wide-eyed and flushed before the mirror, John Farlow</p>
<p>tenderly tapped to inquire if I was okay&#x2013;and I immediately realized it</p>
<p>would be madness on my part to have her in the house with all those</p>
<p>busybodies milling around and scheming to take her away from me. Indeed,</p>
<p>unpredictable Lo herself might&#x2013;who knows?&#x2013;show some foolish distrust of</p>
<p>me, a sudden repugnance, vague fear and the like&#x2013;and gone would be the</p>
<p>magic prize at the very instant of triumph.</p>
<p> Speaking of busybodies, I had another visitor&#x2013;friend Beale, the fellow</p>
<p>who eliminated my wife. Stodgy and solemn, looking like a kind of assistant</p>
<p>executioner, with his bulldog jowls, small black eyes, thickly rimmed</p>
<p>glasses and conspicuous nostrils, he was ushered in by John who then left</p>
<p>us, closing the door upon us, with the utmost tact. Suavely saying he had</p>
<p>twins in my stepdaughter&#x2019;s class, my grotesque visitor unrolled a large</p>
<p>diagram he had made of the accident. It was, as my stepdaughter would have</p>
<p>put it, &#x201C;a beaut,&#x201D; with all kinds of impressive arrows and dotted lines in</p>
<p>varicolored inks. Mrs. H.H.&#x2019;s trajectory was illustrated at several points</p>
<p>by a series of those little outline figures&#x2013;doll-like wee career girl or</p>
<p>WAC&#x2013;used in statistics as visual aids. Very clearly and conclusively, this</p>
<p>route came into contact with a boldly traced sinuous line representing two</p>
<p>consecutive swerves&#x2013;one which the Beale car made to avoid the Junk dog (dog</p>
<p>not shown), and the second, a kind of exaggerated continuation of the first,</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (72 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:53file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>meant to avert the tragedy. A very black cross indicated the spot where the</p>
<p>trim little outline figure had at last come to rest on the sidewalk. I</p>
<p>looked for some similar mark to denote the place on the embankment where my</p>
<p>visitor&#x2019;s huge wax father had reclined, but there was none. That gentleman,</p>
<p>however, had signed the document as a witness underneath the name of Leslie</p>
<p>Tomson, Miss Opposite and a few other people.</p>
<p> With his hummingbird pencil deftly and delicately flying from one point</p>
<p>to another, Frederick demonstrated his absolute innocence and the</p>
<p>recklessness of my wife: while he was in the act of avoiding the dog,</p>
<p>she slipped on the freshly watered asphalt and plunged forward</p>
<p>whereas she should have flung herself not forward but backward (Fred showed</p>
<p>how by a jerk of his padded shoulder). I said it was certainly not his</p>
<p>fault, and the inquest upheld my view.</p>
<p> Breathing violently though jet-black tense nostrils, he shook his head</p>
<p>and my hand; then, with an air of perfect savoir vivre and</p>
<p>gentlemanly generosity, he offered to pay the funeral-home expenses. He</p>
<p>expected me to refuse his offer. With a drunken sob of gratitude I accepted</p>
<p>it. This took him aback. Slowly, incredulously, he repeated what he had</p>
<p>said. I thanked him again, even more profusely than before.</p>
<p> In result of that weird interview, the numbness of my soul was for a</p>
<p>moment resolved. And no wonder! I had actually seen the agent of fate. I had</p>
<p>palpated the very flesh of fate&#x2013;and its padded shoulder. A brilliant and</p>
<p>monstrous mutation had suddenly taken place, and here was the instrument.</p>
<p>Within the intricacies of the pattern (hurrying housewife, slippery</p>
<p>pavement, a pest of a dog, steep grade, big car, baboon at its wheel), I</p>
<p>could dimly distinguish my own vile contribution. Had I not been such a</p>
<p>fool&#x2013;or such an intuitive genius&#x2013;to preserve that journal, fluids produced</p>
<p>by vindictive anger and hot shame would not have blinded Charlotte in her</p>
<p>dash to the mailbox. But even had they blinded her, still nothing might have</p>
<p>happened, had not precise fate, that synchronizing phantom, mixed within its</p>
<p>alembic the car and the dog and the sun and the shade and the wet and the</p>
<p>weak and the strong and the stone. Adieu, Marlene! Fat fate&#x2019;s formal</p>
<p>handshake (as reproduced by Beale before leaving the room) brought me out of</p>
<p>my torpor; and I wept. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury&#x2013;I wept.</p>
<p> 24</p>
<p> The elms and the poplars were turning their ruffled backs to a sudden</p>
<p>onslaught of wind, and a black thunderhead loomed above Ramsdale&#x2019;s white</p>
<p>church tower when I looked around me for the last time. For unknown</p>
<p>adventures I was leaving the livid house where I had rented a room only ten</p>
<p>weeks before. The shades&#x2013;thrifty, practical bamboo shades&#x2013;were already</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (73 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:53file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>down. On porches or in the house their rich textures lend modern drama. The</p>
<p>house of heaven must seem pretty bare after that. A raindrop fell on my</p>
<p>knuckles. I went back into the house for something or other while John was</p>
<p>putting my bags into the car, and then a funny thing happened. I do not know</p>
<p>if in these tragic notes I have sufficiently stressed the peculiar &#x201C;sending&#x201D;</p>
<p>effect that the writer&#x2019;s good looks&#x2013;pseudo-Celtic, attractively simian,</p>
<p>boyishly manly&#x2013;had on women of every age and environment. Of course, such</p>
<p>announcements made in the first person may sound ridiculous. But every once</p>
<p>in a while I have to remind the reader of my appearance much as a</p>
<p>professional novelist, who has given a character of his some mannerism or a</p>
<p>dog, has to go on producing that dog or that mannerism every time the</p>
<p>character crops up in the course of the book. There may be more to it in the</p>
<p>present case. My gloomy good looks should be kept in the mind&#x2019;s eye if my</p>
<p>story is to be properly understood. Pubescent Lo swooned to Humbert&#x2019;s charm</p>
<p>as she did to hiccuppy music; adult Lotte loved me with a mature, possessive</p>
<p>passion that I now deplore and respect more than I care to say. Jean Farlow,</p>
<p>who was thirty-one and absolutely neurotic, had also apparently developed a</p>
<p>strong liking for me. She was handsome in a carved-Indian sort of way, with</p>
<p>a burnt sienna complexion. Her lips were like large crimson polyps, and when</p>
<p>she emitted her special barking laugh, she showed large dull teeth and pale</p>
<p>gums.</p>
<p> She was very tall, wore either slacks with sandals or billowing skirts</p>
<p>with ballet slippers, drank any strong liquor in any amount, had had two</p>
<p>miscarriages, wrote stories about animals, painted, as the reader knows,</p>
<p>lakescapes, was already nursing the cancer that was to kill her at</p>
<p>thirty-three, and was hopelessly unattractive to me. Judge then of my alarm</p>
<p>when a few seconds before I left (she and I stood in the hallway) Jean, with</p>
<p>her always trembling fingers, took me by the temples, and, tears in her</p>
<p>bright blue eyes, attempted, unsuccessfully, to glue herself to my lips.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Take care of yourself,&#x201D; she said, &#x201C;kiss your daughter for me.&#x201D;</p>
<p> A clap of thunder reverberated throughout the house, and she added:</p>
<p> &#x201C;Perhaps, somewhere, some day, at a less miserable time, we may see</p>
<p>each other again&#x201D; (Jean, whatever, wherever you are, in minus time-space or</p>
<p>plus soul-time, forgive me all this, parenthesis included).</p>
<p> And presently I was shaking hands with both of them in the street, the</p>
<p>sloping street, and everything was whirling and flying before the</p>
<p>approaching white deluge, and a truck with a mattress from Philadelphia was</p>
<p>confidently rolling down to an empty house, and dust was running and</p>
<p>writhing over the exact slab of stone where Charlotte, when they lifted the</p>
<p>laprobe for me, had been revealed, curled up, her eyes intact, their black</p>
<p>lashes still wet, matted, like yours, Lolita.</p>
<p> 25</p>

<p> One might suppose that with all blocks removed and a prospect of</p>
<p>delirious and unlimited delights before me, I would have mentally sunk back,</p>
<p>heaving a sigh of delicious relief. Eh bien, pas du tout! Instead of</p>
<p>basking in the beams of smiling Chance, I was obsessed by all sorts of</p>
<p>purely ethical doubts and fears. For instance: might it not surprise people</p>
<p>that Lo was so consistently debarred from attending festive and funeral</p>
<p>functions in her immediate family? You remember&#x2013;we had not had her at our</p>
<p>wedding. Or another thing: granted it was the long hairy arm of Coincidence</p>
<p>that had reached out to remove an innocent woman, might Coincidence not</p>
<p>ignore in a heathen moment what its twin lamb had done and hand Lo a</p>
<p>premature note of commiseration? True, the accident had been reported only</p>
<p>by the Ramsdale Journal&#x2013;not by the Parkington Recorder or the</p>
<p>Climax Herald, Camp Q being in another state, and local deaths having</p>
<p>no federal news interest; but I could not help fancying that somehow Dolly</p>
<p>Haze had been informed already, and that at the very time I was on my way to</p>
<p>fetch her, she was being driven to Ramsdale by friends unknown to me. Still</p>
<p>more disquieting than all these conjectures and worries, was the fact that</p>
<p>Humbert Humbert, a brand-new American citizen of obscure European origin,</p>
<p>had taken no steps toward becoming the legal guardian of his dead wife&#x2019;s</p>
<p>daughter (twelve years and seven months old). Would I ever dare take those</p>
<p>steps? I could not repress a shiver whenever I imagined my nudity hemmed in</p>
<p>by mysterious statutes in the merciless glare of the Common Law.</p>
<p> My scheme was a marvel of primitive art: I would whizz over to Camp Q,</p>
<p>tell Lolita her mother was about to undergo a major operation at an invented</p>
<p>hospital, and then keep moving with my sleepy nymphet from inn to inn while</p>
<p>her mother got better and better and finally died. But as I traveled</p>
<p>campward my anxiety grew. I could not bear to think I might not find Lolita</p>
<p>there&#x2013;or find, instead, another, scared, Lolita clamoring for some family</p>
<p>friend: not the Farlows, thank God&#x2013;she hardly knew them&#x2013;but might there</p>
<p>not be other people I had not reckoned with? Finally, I decided to make the</p>
<p>long-distance call I had simulated so well a few days before. It was raining</p>
<p>hard when I pulled up in a muddy suburb of Parkington, just before the Fork,</p>
<p>one prong of which bypassed the city and led to the highway which crossed</p>
<p>the hills to Lake Climax and Camp Q. I flipped off the ignition and for</p>
<p>quite a minute sat in the car bracing myself for that telephone call, and</p>
<p>staring at the rain, at the inundated sidewalk, at a hydrant: a hideous</p>
<p>thing, really, painted a thick silver and red, extending the red stumps of</p>
<p>its arms to be varnished by the rain which like stylized blood dripped upon</p>
<p>its argent chains. No wonder that stopping beside those nightmare cripples</p>
<p>is taboo. I drove up to a gasoline station. A surprise awaited me when at</p>
<p>last the coins had satisfactorily clanked down and a voice was allowed to</p>
<p>answer mine.</p>
<p> Holmes, the camp mistress, informed me that Dolly had gone Monday (this</p>
<p>was Wednesday) on a hike in the hills with her group and was expected to</p>
<p>return rather late today. Would I care to come tomorrow, and what was</p>
<p>exactly&#x2013;Without going into details, I said that her mother was</p>
<p>hospitalized, that the situation was grave, that the child should not be</p>
<p>told it was grave and that she should be ready to leave with me tomorrow</p>
<p>afternoon. The two voices parted in an explosion of warmth and good will,</p>
<p>and through some freak mechanical flaw all my coins came tumbling back to me</p>
<p>with a hitting-the-jackpot clatter that almost made me laugh despite the</p>
<p>disappointment at having to postpone bliss. One wonders if this sudden</p>
<p>discharge, this spasmodic refund, was not correlated somehow, in the mind of</p>
<p>McFate, with my having invented that little expedition before ever learning</p>
<p>of it as I did now.</p>
<p> What next? I proceeded to the business center of Parkington and devoted</p>
<p>the whole afternoon (the weather had cleared, the wet town was like</p>
<p>silver-and-glass) to buying beautiful things for Lo. Goodness, what crazy</p>
<p>purchases were prompted by the poignant predilection Humbert had in those</p>
<p>days for check weaves, bright cottons, frills, puffed-out short sleeves,</p>
<p>soft pleats, snug-fitting bodices and generously full skirts! Oh Lolita, you</p>
<p>are my girl, as Vee was Poe&#x2019;s and Bea Dante&#x2019;s, and what little girl would</p>
<p>not like to whirl in a circular skirt and scanties? Did I have something</p>
<p>special in mind? coaxing voices asked me. Swimming suits? We have them in</p>
<p>all shades. Dream pink, frosted aqua, glans mauve, tulip red, oolala black.</p>
<p>What about playsuits? Slips? No slips. Lo and I loathed slips.</p>
<p> One of my guides in these matters was an anthropometric entry made by</p>
<p>her mother on Lo&#x2019;s twelfth birthday (the reader remembers that</p>
<p>Know-Your-Child book). I had the feeling that Charlotte, moved by obscure</p>
<p>motives of envy and dislike, had added an inch here, a pound there; but</p>
<p>since the nymphet had no doubt grown somewhat in the last seven months, I</p>
<p>thought I could safely accept most of those January measurements: hip girth,</p>
<p>twenty-nine inches; thigh girth (just below the gluteal sulcus), seventeen;</p>
<p>calf girth and neck circumference, eleven; chest circumference,</p>
<p>twenty-seven; upper arm girth, eight; waist, twenty-three; stature,</p>
<p>fifty-seven inches; weight, seventy-eight pounds; figure, linear;</p>
<p>intelligence quotient, 121; vermiform appendix present, thank God.</p>
<p> Apart from measurements, I could of course visualize Lolita with</p>
<p>hallucinational lucidity; and nursing as I did a tingle on my breastbone at</p>
<p>the exact spot her silky top had come level once or twice with my heart; and</p>
<p>feeling as I did her warm weight in my lap (so that, in a sense, I was</p>
<p>always &#x201C;with Lolita&#x201D; as a woman is &#x201C;with child&#x201D;), I was not surprised to</p>
<p>discover later that my computation had been more or less correct. Having</p>
<p>moreover studied a midsummer sale book, it was with a very knowing air that</p>
<p>I examined various pretty articles, sport shoes, sneakers, pumps of crushed</p>
<p>kid for crushed kids. The painted girl in black who attended to all these</p>
<p>poignant needs of mine turned parental scholarship and precise description</p>
<p>into commercial euphemisms, such as &#x201C;petite.&#x201D; Another, much older</p>
<p>woman, in a white dress, with a pancake make-up, seemed to be oddly</p>
<p>impressed by my knowledge of junior fashions; perhaps I had a midget for</p>
<p>mistress; so, when shown a skirt with &#x201C;cute&#x201D; pockets in front, I</p>
<p>intentionally put a naive male question and was rewarded by a smiling</p>
<p>demonstration of the way the zipper worked in the back of the skirt. I had</p>
<p>next great fun with all kinds of shorts and briefs&#x2013;phantom little Lolitas</p>
<p>dancing, falling, daisying all over the counter. We rounded up the deal with</p>
<p>some prim cotton pajamas in popular butcher-boy style. Humbert, the popular</p>
<p>butcher.</p>
<p> There is a touch of the mythological and the enchanted in those large</p>
<p>stores where according to ads a career girl can get a complete desk-to-date</p>
<p>wardrobe, and where little sister can dream of the day when her wool jersey</p>
<p>will make the boys in the back row of the classroom drool. Life-size plastic</p>
<p>figures of snubbed-nosed children with dun-colored, greenish, brown-dotted,</p>
<p>faunish faces floated around me. I realized I was the only shopper in that</p>
<p>rather eerie place where I moved about fishlike, in a glaucous aquarium. I</p>
<p>sensed strange thoughts form in the minds of the languid ladies that</p>
<p>escorted me from counter to counter, from rock ledge to seaweed, and the</p>
<p>belts and the bracelets I chose seemed to fall from siren hands into</p>
<p>transparent water. I bought an elegant valise, had my purchases put into it,</p>
<p>and repaired to the nearest hotel, well pleased with my day.</p>
<p> Somehow, in connection with that quiet poetical afternoon of fastidious</p>
<p>shopping, I recalled the hotel or inn with the seductive name of The</p>
<p>Enchanted Hunters with Charlotte had happened to mention shortly before my</p>
<p>liberation. With the help of a guidebook I located it in the secluded town</p>
<p>of Briceland, a four-hour drive from Lo&#x2019;s camp. I could have telephoned but</p>
<p>fearing my voice might go out of control and lapse into coy croaks of broken</p>
<p>English, I decided to send a wire ordering a room with twin beds for the</p>
<p>next night. What a comic, clumsy, wavering Prince Charming I was! How some</p>
<p>of my readers will laugh at me when I tell them the trouble I had with the</p>
<p>wording of my telegram! What should I put: Humbert and daughter? Humberg and</p>
<p>small daughter? Homberg and immature girl? Homburg and child? The droll</p>
<p>mistake&#x2013;the &#x201C;g&#x201D; at the end&#x2013;which eventually came through may have been a</p>
<p>telepathic echo of these hesitations of mine.</p>
<p> And then, in the velvet of a summer night, my broodings over the philer</p>
<p>I had with me! Oh miserly Hamburg! Was he not a very Enchanted Hunter as he</p>
<p>deliberated with himself over his boxful of magic ammunition? To rout the</p>
<p>monster of insomnia should he try himself one of those amethyst capsules?</p>
<p>There were forty of them, all told&#x2013;forty nights with a frail little sleeper</p>
<p>at my throbbing side; could I rob myself of one such night in order to</p>
<p>sleep? Certainly not: much too precious was each tiny plum, each microscopic</p>
<p>planetarium with its live stardust. Oh, let me be mawkish for the nonce! I</p>
<p>am so tired of being cynical.</p>
<p> 26</p>
<p> This daily headache in the opaque air of this tombal jail is</p>
<p>disturbing, but I must persevere. Have written more than a hundred pages and</p>
<p>not got anywhere yet. My calendar is getting confused. That must have been</p>
<p>around August 15, 1947. Don&#x2019;t think I can go on. Heart, head&#x2013;everything.</p>
<p>Lolita, Lolita, Lolita, Lolita, Lolita, Lolita, Lolita, Lolita, Lolita,</p>
<p>Lolita. Repeat till the page is full, printer.</p>
<p> 27</p>
<p> Still in Parkington. Finally, I did achieve an hour&#x2019;s slumber&#x2013;from</p>
<p>which I was aroused by gratuitous and horribly exhausting congress with a</p>
<p>small hairy hermaphrodite, a total stranger. By then it was six in the</p>
<p>morning, and it suddenly occurred to me it might be a good thing to arrive</p>
<p>at the camp earlier than I had said. From Parkington I had still a hundred</p>
<p>miles to go, and there would be more than that to the Hazy Hills and</p>
<p>Briceland. If I had said I would come for Dolly in the afternoon, it was</p>
<p>only because my fancy insisted on merciful night falling as soon as possible</p>
<p>upon my impatience. But now I foresaw all kinds of misunderstandings and was</p>
<p>all a-jitter lest delay might give her the opportunity of some idle</p>
<p>telephone call to Ramsdale. However, when at 9.30 a.m. I attempted to start,</p>
<p>I was confronted by a dead battery, and noon was nigh when at last I left</p>
<p>Parkington.</p>
<p> I reached my destination around half past two; parked my car in a pine</p>
<p>grove where a green-shirted, redheaded impish lad stood throwing horseshoes</p>
<p>in sullen solitude; was laconically directed by him to an office in a stucco</p>
<p>cottage; in a dying state, had to endure for several minutes the inquisitive</p>
<p>commiseration of the camp mistress, a sluttish worn out female with rusty</p>
<p>hair. Dolly she said was all packed and ready to go. She knew her mother was</p>
<p>sick but not critically. Would Mr. Haze, I mean, Mr. Humbert, care to meet</p>
<p>the camp counselors? Or look at the cabins where the girls live? Each</p>
<p>dedicated to a Disney creature? Or visit the Lodge? Or should Charlie be</p>
<p>sent over to fetch her? The girls were just finishing fixing the Dining Room</p>
<p>for a dance. (And perhaps afterwards she would say to somebody or other:</p>
<p>&#x201C;The poor guy looked like his own ghost.&#x201D;)</p>
<p> Let me retain for a moment that scene in all its trivial and fateful</p>
<p>detail: hag Holmes writing out a receipt, scratching her head, pulling a</p>
<p>drawer out of her desk, pouring change into my impatient palm, then neatly</p>
<p>spreading a banknote over it with a bright &#x201C;. . . and five!&#x201D;; photographs of</p>
<p>girl-children; some gaudy moth or butterfly, still alive, safely pinned to</p>
<p>the wall (&#x201C;nature study&#x201D;); the framed diploma of the camp&#x2019;s dietitian; my</p>
<p>trembling hands; a card produced by efficient Holmes with a report of Dolly</p>
<p>Haze&#x2019;s behavior for July (&#x201C;fair to good; keen on swimming and boating&#x201D;); a</p>
<p>sound of trees and birds, and my pounding heart . . . I was standing with my</p>
<p>back to the open door, and then I felt the blood rush to my head as I heart</p>
<p>her respiration and voice behind me. She arrived dragging and bumping her</p>
<p>heavy suitcase. &#x201C;Hi!&#x201D; she said, and stood still, looking at me with sly,</p>
<p>glad eyes, her soft lips parted in a slightly foolish but wonderfully</p>
<p>endearing smile.</p>
<p> She was thinner and taller, and for a second it seemed to me her face</p>
<p>was less pretty than the mental imprint I had cherished for more than a</p>
<p>month: her cheeks looked hollowed and too much lentigo camouflaged her rosy</p>
<p>rustic features; and that first impression (a very narrow human interval</p>
<p>between two tiger heartbeats) carried the clear implication that all widower</p>
<p>Humbert had to do, wanted to do, or would do, was to give this wan-looking</p>
<p>though sun-colored little orphan au yeux battus (and even those</p>
<p>plumbaceous umbrae under her eyes bore freckles) a sound education, a</p>
<p>healthy and happy girlhood, a clean home, nice girl-friends of her age among</p>
<p>whom (if the fates deigned to repay me) I might find, perhaps, a pretty</p>
<p>little Magdlein for Herr Doktor Humbert alone. But &#x201C;in a wink,&#x201D; as</p>
<p>the Germans say, the angelic line of conduct was erased, and I overtook my</p>
<p>prey (time moves ahead of our fancies!), and she was my Lolita again&#x2013;in</p>
<p>fact, more of my Lolita than ever. I let my hand rest on her warm auburn</p>
<p>head and took up her bag. She was all rose and honey, dressed in her</p>
<p>brightest gingham, with a pattern of little red apples, and her arms and</p>
<p>legs were of a deep golden brown, with scratches like tiny dotted lines of</p>
<p>coagulated rubies, and the ribbed cuffs of her white socks were turned down</p>
<p>at the remembered level, and because of her childish gait, or because I had</p>
<p>memorized her as always wearing heelless shoes, her saddle oxfords looked</p>
<p>somehow too large and too high-heeled for her. Good-bye, Camp Q, merry Camp</p>
<p>Q. Good-bye, plain unwholesome food, good-bye Charlie boy. In the hot car</p>
<p>she settled down beside me, slapped a prompt fly on her lovely knee; then,</p>
<p>her mouth working violently on a piece of chewing gum, she rapidly cranked</p>
<p>down the window on her side and settled back again. We sped through the</p>
<p>striped and speckled forest.</p>
<p> &#x201C;How&#x2019;s Mother?&#x201D; she asked dutifully.</p>
<p> I said the doctors did not quite know yet what the trouble was. Anyway,</p>
<p>something abdominal. Abominable? No, abdominal. We would have to hang around</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (79 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>for a while. The hospital was in the country, near the gay town of</p>
<p>Lepingville, where a great poet had resided in the early nineteenth century</p>
<p>and where we would take in all the shows. She thought it a peachy idea and</p>
<p>wondered if we could make Lepingville before nine p.m.</p>
<p> &#x201C;We should be at Briceland by dinner time,&#x201D; I said, &#x201C;and tomorrow we&#x2019;ll</p>
<p>visit Lepingville. How was the hike? Did you have a marvelous time at the</p>
<p>camp?&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Uh-huh.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Sorry to leave?&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Un-un.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Talk, Lo&#x2013;don&#x2019;t grunt. Tell me something.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;What thing, Dad?&#x201D; (she let the word expand with ironic deliberation).</p>
<p> &#x201C;Any old thing.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Okay, if I call you that?&#x201D; (eyes slit at the road).</p>
<p> &#x201C;Quite.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;It&#x2019;s a sketch, you know. When did you fall for my mummy?&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Some day, Lo, you will understand many emotions and situations, such</p>
<p>as for example the harmony, the beauty of spiritual relationship.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Bah!&#x201D; said the cynical nymphet.</p>
<p> Shallow lull in the dialogue, filled with some landscape.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Look, Lo, at all those cows on that hillside.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;I think I&#x2019;ll vomit if I look at a cow again.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;You know, I missed you terribly, Lo.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;I did not. Fact I&#x2019;ve been revoltingly unfaithful to you, but it</p>
<p>does not matter one bit, because you&#x2019;ve stopped caring for me, anyway. You</p>
<p>drive much faster than my mummy, mister.&#x201D;</p>
<p> I slowed down from a blind seventy to a purblind fifty.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Why do you think I have ceased caring for you, Lo?&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Well, you haven&#x2019;t kissed me yet, have you?&#x201D;</p>
<p> Inly dying, inly moaning, I glimpsed a reasonably wide shoulder of road</p>
<p>ahead, and bumped and wobbled into the weeds. Remember she is only a child,</p>
<p>remember she is only&#x2013;</p>
<p> Hardly had the car come to a standstill than Lolita positively flowed</p>
<p>into my arms. Not daring, not daring let myself go&#x2013;not even daring let</p>
<p>myself realize that this (sweet wetness and trembling fire) was the</p>
<p>beginning of the ineffable life which, ably assisted by fate, I had finally</p>
<p>willed into being&#x2013;not daring really kiss her, I touched her hot, opening</p>
<p>lips with the utmost piety, tiny sips, nothing salacious; but she, with an</p>
<p>impatient wriggle, pressed her mouth to mine so hard that I felt her big</p>
<p>front teeth and shared in the peppermint taste of her saliva. I knew, of</p>
<p>course, it was but an innocent game on her part, a bit of backfisch foolery</p>
<p>in imitation of some simulacrum of fake romance, and since (as the</p>
<p>psychotherapist, as well as the rapist, will tell you) the limits and rules</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (80 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>of such girlish games are fluid, or at least too childishly subtle for the</p>
<p>senior partner to grasp&#x2013;I was dreadfully afraid I might go too far and</p>
<p>cause her to start back in revulsion and terror. And, as above all I was</p>
<p>agonizingly anxious to smuggle her into the hermetic seclusion of The</p>
<p>Enchanted Hunters, and we had still eighty miles to go, blessed intuition</p>
<p>broke our embrace&#x2013;a split second before a highway patrol car drew up</p>
<p>alongside.</p>
<p> Florid and beetle-browed, its driver stared at me:</p>
<p> &#x201C;Happen to see a blue sedan, same make as yours, pass you before the</p>
<p>junction?&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Why, no.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;We didn&#x2019;t,&#x201D; said Lo, eagerly leaning across me, her innocent hand on</p>
<p>my legs, &#x201C;but are you sure it was blue, because&#x2013;&#x201D;</p>
<p> The cop (what shadow of us was he after?) gave the little colleen his</p>
<p>best smile and went into a U-turn.</p>
<p> We drove on.</p>
<p> &#x201C;The fruithead!&#x201D; remarked Lo. &#x201C;He should have nabbed you.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Why me for heaven&#x2019;s sake?&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Well, the speed in this bum state is fifty, and&#x2013;No, don&#x2019;t slow down,</p>
<p>you, dull bulb. He&#x2019;s gone now.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;We have still quite a stretch,&#x201D; I said, &#x201C;and I want to get there</p>
<p>before dark. So be a good girl.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Bad, bad girl,&#x201D; said Lo comfortably. &#x201C;Juvenile delickwent, but frank</p>
<p>and fetching. That light was red. I&#x2019;ve never seen such driving.&#x201D;</p>
<p> We rolled silently through a silent townlet.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Say, wouldn&#x2019;t Mother be absolutely mad if she found out we were</p>
<p>lovers?&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Good Lord, Lo, let us not talk that way.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;But we are lovers, aren&#x2019;t we?&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Not that I know of. I think we are going to have some more rain. Don&#x2019;t</p>
<p>you want to tell me of those little pranks of yours in camp?&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;You talk like a book, Dad.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;What have you been up to? I insist you tell me.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Are you easily shocked?&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;No. Go on.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Let us turn into a secluded lane and I&#x2019;ll tell you.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Lo, I must seriously ask you not to play the fool. Well?&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Well&#x2013;I joined in all the activities that were offered.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Ensuite?&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Ansooit, I was taught to live happily and richly with others and to</p>
<p>develop a wholesome personality. Be a cake, in fact.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Yes. I saw something of the sort in the booklet.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;We loved the sings around the fire in the big stone fireplace or under</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (81 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>the darned stars, where every girl merged her own spirit of happiness with</p>
<p>the voice of the group.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Your memory is excellent, Lo, but I must trouble you to leave out the</p>
<p>swear words. Anything else?&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;The Girl Scout&#x2019;s motto,&#x201D; said Lo rhapsodically, &#x201C;is also mine. I fill</p>
<p>my life with worthwhile deeds such as&#x2013;well, never mind what. My duty is&#x2013;to</p>
<p>be useful. I am a friend to male animals. I obey orders. I am cheerful. That</p>
<p>was another police car. I am thrifty and I am absolutely filthy in thought,</p>
<p>word and deed.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Now I do hope that&#x2019;s all, you witty child.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Yep. That&#x2019;s all. No&#x2013;wait a sec. We baked in a reflector oven. Isn&#x2019;t</p>
<p>that terrific?&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Well, that&#x2019;s better.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;We washed zillions of dishes. &#x2018;Zillions&#x2019; you know is schoolmarm&#x2019;s</p>
<p>slang for many-many-many-many. Oh yes, last but not least, as Mother</p>
<p>says&#x2013;Now let me see&#x2013;what was it? I know we made shadowgraphs. Gee, what</p>
<p>fun.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;C&#x2019;est bien tout?&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;C&#x2019;est. Except for one little thing, something I simply can&#x2019;t</p>
<p>tell you without blushing all over.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Will you tell it me later?&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;If we sit in the dark and you let me whisper, I will. Do you sleep in</p>
<p>your old room or in a heap with Mother?&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Old room. Your mother may have to undergo a very serious operation,</p>
<p>Lo.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Stop at that candy bar, will you,&#x201D; said Lo.</p>
<p> Sitting on a high stool, a band of sunlight crossing her bare brown</p>
<p>forearm, Lolita was served an elaborate ice-cream concoction topped with</p>
<p>synthetic syrup. It was erected and brought her by a pimply brute of a boy</p>
<p>in a greasy bow-tie who eyed my fragile child in her thin cotton frock with</p>
<p>carnal deliberation. My impatience to reach Briceland and The Enchanted</p>
<p>Hunters was becoming more than I could endure. Fortunately she dispatched</p>
<p>the stuff with her usual alacrity.</p>
<p> &#x201C;How much cash do you have?&#x201D; I asked.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Not a cent,&#x201D; she said sadly, lifting her eyebrows, showing me the</p>
<p>empty inside of her money purse.</p>
<p> &#x201C;This is a matter that will be mended in due time,&#x201D; I rejoined archly.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Are you coming?&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Say, I wonder if they have a washroom.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;you are not going there,&#x201D; I said Firmly. &#x201C;It is sure to be a vile</p>
<p>place. Do come on.&#x201D;</p>
<p> She was on the whole an obedient little girl and I kissed her in the</p>
<p>neck when we got back into the car.</p>

<p> &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t do that,&#x201D; she said looking at me with unfeigned surprise.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t drool on me. You dirty man.&#x201D;</p>
<p> She rubbed the spot against her raised shoulder.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Sorry,&#x201D; I murmured. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m rather fond of you, that&#x2019;s all.&#x201D;</p>
<p> We drove under a gloomy sky, up a winding road, then down again.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Well, I&#x2019;m also sort of fond of you,&#x201D; said Lolita in a delayed soft</p>
<p>voice, with a sort of sigh, and sort of settled closer to me.</p>
<p> (Oh, my Lolita, we shall never get there!)</p>
<p> Dusk was beginning to saturate pretty little Briceland, its phony</p>
<p>colonial architecture, curiosity sops and imported shade trees, when we</p>
<p>drove through the weakly lighted streets in search of the Enchanted Hunters.</p>
<p>The air, despite a steady drizzle beading it, was warm and green, and a</p>
<p>queue of people, mainly children and old men, had already formed before the</p>
<p>box office of a movie house, dripping with jewel-fires.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Oh, I want to see that picture. Let&#x2019;s go right after dinner. Oh,</p>
<p>let&#x2019;s!&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;We might,&#x201D; chanted Humbert&#x2013;knowing perfectly well, the sly tumescent</p>
<p>devil, that by nine, when his show began, she would be dead in his</p>
<p>arms.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Easy!&#x201D; cried Lo, lurching forward, as an accursed truck in front of</p>
<p>us, its backside carbuncles pulsating, stopped at a crossing.</p>
<p> If we did not get to the hotel soon, immediately, miraculously, in the</p>
<p>very next block, I felt I would lose all control over the Haze jalopy with</p>
<p>its ineffectual wipers and whimsical brakes; but the passers-by I applied to</p>
<p>for directions were either strangers themselves or asked with a frown</p>
<p>&#x201C;Enchanted what?&#x201D; as if I were a madman; or else they went into such</p>
<p>complicated explanations, with geometrical gestures, geographical</p>
<p>generalities and strictly local clues (. . . then bear south after you hit</p>
<p>the court-house. . .) that I could not help losing my way in the maze of</p>
<p>their well-meaning gibberish. Lo, whose lovely prismatic entrails had</p>
<p>already digested the sweetmeat, was looking forward to a big meal and had</p>
<p>begun to fidget. As to me, although I had long become used to a kind of</p>
<p>secondary fate (McFate&#x2019;s inept secretary, so to speak) pettily interfering</p>
<p>with the boss&#x2019;s generous magnificent plan&#x2013;to grind and grope through the</p>
<p>avenues of Briceland was perhaps the most exasperating ordeal I had yet</p>
<p>faced. In later months I could laugh at my inexperience when recalling the</p>
<p>obstinate boyish way in which I had concentrated upon that particular inn</p>
<p>with its fancy name; for all along our route countless motor courts</p>
<p>proclaimed their vacancy in neon lights, ready to accommodate salesmen,</p>
<p>escaped convicts, impotents, family groups, as well as the most corrupt and</p>
<p>vigorous couples. Ah, gentle drivers gliding through summer&#x2019;s black nights,</p>
<p>what frolics, what twists of lust, you might see from your impeccable</p>
<p>highways if Kumfy Kabins were suddenly drained of their pigments and became</p>

<p>as transparent as boxes of glass!</p>
<p> The miracle I hankered for did happen after all. A man and a girl, more</p>
<p>or less conjoined in a dark car under dripping trees, told us we were in the</p>
<p>heart of The Park, but had only to turn left at the next traffic light and</p>
<p>there we would be. We did not see any next traffic light&#x2013;in fact, The Park</p>
<p>was as black as the sins it concealed&#x2013;but soon after falling under the</p>
<p>smooth spell of a nicely graded curve, the travelers became aware of a</p>
<p>diamond glow through the mist, then a gleam of lakewater appeared&#x2013;and there</p>
<p>it was, marvelously and inexorably, under spectral trees, at the top of a</p>
<p>graveled drive&#x2013;the pale palace of The Enchanted Hunters.</p>
<p> A row of parked cars, like pigs at a trough, seemed at first sight to</p>
<p>forbid access; but then, by magic, a formidable convertible, resplendent,</p>
<p>rubious in the lighted rain, came into motion&#x2013;was energetically backed out</p>
<p>by a broad-shouldered driver&#x2013;and we gratefully slipped into the gap it had</p>
<p>left. I immediately regretted my haste for I noticed that my predecessor had</p>
<p>now taken advantage of a garage-like shelter nearby where there was ample</p>
<p>space for another car; but I was too impatient to follow his example.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Wow! Looks swank,&#x201D; remarked my vulgar darling squinting at the stucco</p>
<p>as she crept out into the audible drizzle and with a childish hand tweaked</p>
<p>loose the frock-fold that had struck in the peach-cleft&#x2013;to quote Robert</p>
<p>Browning. Under the arclights enlarged replicas of chestnut leaves plunged</p>
<p>and played on white pillars. I unlocked the trunk compartment. A hunchbacked</p>
<p>and hoary Negro in a uniform of sorts took our bags and wheeled them slowly</p>
<p>into the lobby. It was full of old ladies and clergy men. Lolita sank down</p>
<p>on her haunches to caress a pale-faced, blue-freckled, black-eared cocker</p>
<p>spaniel swooning on the floral carpet under her hand&#x2013;as who would not, my</p>
<p>heart&#x2013;while I cleared my throat through the throng to the desk. There a</p>
<p>bald porcine old man&#x2013;everybody was old in that old hotel&#x2013;examined my</p>
<p>features with a polite smile, then leisurely produced my (garbled) telegram,</p>
<p>wrestled with some dark doubts, turned his head to look at the clock, and</p>
<p>finally said he was very sorry, he had held the room with the twin beds till</p>
<p>half past six, and now it was gone. A religious convention, he said, had</p>
<p>clashed with a flower show in Briceland, and&#x2013;&#x201D;The name,&#x201D; I said coldly, &#x201C;is</p>
<p>not Humberg and not Humbug, but Herbert, I mean Humbert, and any room will</p>
<p>do, just put in a cot for my little daughter. She is ten and very tired.&#x201D;</p>
<p> The pink old fellow peered good-naturedly at Lo&#x2013;still squatting,</p>
<p>listening in profile, lips parted, to what the dog&#x2019;s mistress, an ancient</p>
<p>lady swathed in violet veils, was telling her from the depths of a cretonne</p>
<p>easy chair.</p>
<p> Whatever doubts the obscene fellow had, they were dispelled by that</p>
<p>blossom-like vision. He said, he might still have a room, had one, in</p>
<p>fact&#x2013;with a double bed. As to the cot&#x2013;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Mr. Potts, do we have any cots left?&#x201D; Potts, also pink and bald, with</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (84 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>white hairs growing out of his ears and other holes, would see what could be</p>
<p>done. He came and spoke while I unscrewed my fountain pen. Impatient</p>
<p>Humbert!</p>
<p> &#x201C;Our double beds are really triple,&#x201D; Potts cozily said tucking me and</p>
<p>my kid in. &#x201C;One crowded night we had three ladies and a child like yours</p>
<p>sleep together. I believe one of the ladies was a disguised man [my</p>
<p>static]. However&#x2013;would there be a spare cot in 49, Mr. Swine?</p>
<p> &#x201C;I think it went to the Swoons,&#x201D; said Swine, the initial old clown.</p>
<p> &#x201C;We&#x2019;ll manage somehow,&#x201D; I said. &#x201C;My wife may join us later&#x2013;but even</p>
<p>then, I suppose, we&#x2019;ll manage.&#x201D;</p>
<p> The two pink pigs were now among my best friends. In the slow clear</p>
<p>hand of crime I wrote: Dr. Edgar H. Humbert and daughter, 342 Lawn Street,</p>
<p>Ramsdale. A key (342!) was half-shown to me (magician showing object he is</p>
<p>about to palm)&#x2013;and handed over to Uncle tom. Lo, leaving the dog as she</p>
<p>would leave me some day, rose from her haunches; a raindrop fell on</p>
<p>Charlotte&#x2019;s grave; a handsome young Negress slipped open the elevator door,</p>
<p>and the doomed child went in followed by her throat-clearing father and</p>
<p>crayfish Tom with the bags.</p>
<p> Parody of a hotel corridor. Parody of silence and death.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Say, it&#x2019;s our house number,&#x201D; said cheerful Lo.</p>
<p> There was a double bed, a mirror, a double bed in the mirror, a closet</p>
<p>door with mirror, a bathroom door ditto, a blue-dark window, a reflected bed</p>
<p>there, the same in the closet mirror, two chairs, a glass-topped table, two</p>
<p>bedtables, a double bed: a big panel bed, to be exact, with a Tuscan rose</p>
<p>chenille spread, and two frilled, pink-shaded nightlamps, left and right.</p>
<p> I was tempted to place a five-dollar bill in that sepia palm, but</p>
<p>thought the largesse might be misconstrued, so I placed a quarter. Added</p>
<p>another. He withdrew. Click. Enfin seuls.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Are we going to sleep in one room?&#x201D; said Lo, her features</p>
<p>working in that dynamic way they did&#x2013;not cross or disgusted (though plain</p>
<p>on the brink of it) but just dynamic&#x2013;when she wanted to load a question</p>
<p>with violent significance.</p>
<p> &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve asked them to put in a cot. Which I&#x2019;ll use if you like.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;You are crazy,&#x201D; said Lo.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Why, my darling?&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Because, my dahrling, when dahrling Mother finds out she&#x2019;ll divorce</p>
<p>you and strangle me.&#x201D;</p>
<p> Just dynamic. Not really taking the matter too seriously.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Now look here,&#x201D; I said, sitting down, while she stood, a few feet away</p>
<p>from me, and stared at herself contentedly, not unpleasantly surprised at</p>
<p>her own appearance, filling with her own rosy sunshine the surprised and</p>
<p>pleased closet-door mirror.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Look here, Lo. Let&#x2019;s settle this once for all. For all practical</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (85 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>purposes I am your father. I have a feeling of great tenderness for you. In</p>
<p>your mother&#x2019;s absence I am responsible for your welfare. We are not rich,</p>
<p>and while we travel, we shall be obliged&#x2013;we shall be thrown a good deal</p>
<p>together. Two people sharing one room, inevitably enter into a kind&#x2013;how</p>
<p>shall I say&#x2013;a kind&#x2013;&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;The word is incest,&#x201D; said Lo&#x2013;and walked into the closet, walked out</p>
<p>again with a young golden giggle, opened the adjoining door, and after</p>
<p>carefully peering inside with her strange smoky eyes lest she make another</p>
<p>mistake, retired to the bathroom.</p>
<p> I opened the window, tore off my sweat-drenched shirt, changed, checked</p>
<p>the pill vial in my coat pocket, unlocked the&#x2013;</p>
<p> She drifted out. I tried to embrace her: casually, a bit of controlled</p>
<p>tenderness before dinner.</p>
<p> She said: &#x201C;Look, let&#x2019;s cut out the kissing game and get something to</p>
<p>eat.&#x201D;</p>
<p> It was then that I sprang my surprise.</p>
<p> Oh, what a dreamy pet! She walked up to the open suitcase as if</p>
<p>stalking it from afar, at a kind of slow-motion walk, peering at that</p>
<p>distant treasure box on the luggage support. (Was there something wrong, I</p>
<p>wondered, with those great gray eyes of hers, or were we both plunged in the</p>
<p>same enchanted mist?) She stepped up to it, lifting her rather high-heeled</p>
<p>feet rather high, and bending her beautiful boy-knees while she walked</p>
<p>through dilating space with the lentor of one walking under water or in a</p>
<p>flight dream. Then she raised by the armlets a copper-colored, charming and</p>
<p>quite expensive vest, very slowly stretching it between her silent hands as</p>
<p>if she were a bemused bird-hunter holding his breath over the incredible</p>
<p>bird he spreads out by the tips of its flaming wings. Then (while I stood</p>
<p>waiting for her) she pulled out the slow snake of a brilliant belt and tried</p>
<p>it on.</p>
<p> Then she crept into my waiting arms, radiant, relaxed, caressing me</p>
<p>with her tender, mysterious, impure, indifferent, twilight eyes&#x2013;for all the</p>
<p>world, like the cheapest of cheap cuties. For that is what nymphets</p>
<p>imitate&#x2013;while we moan and die.</p>
<p> &#x201C;What&#x2019;s the katter with misses?&#x201D; I muttered (word-control gone) into</p>
<p>her hair.</p>
<p> &#x201C;If you must know,&#x201D; she said, &#x201C;you do it the wrong way.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Show, wight ray.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;All in good time,&#x201D; responded the spoonerette.</p>
<p> Seva ascendes, pulsata, brulans, kizelans, dementissima. Elevator</p>
<p>clatterans, pausa, clatterans, populus in corridoro. Hanc nisi mors mihi</p>
<p>adimet nemo! Juncea puellula, jo pensavo fondissime, nobserva nihil</p>
<p>quidquam; but, of course, in another moment I might have committed some</p>
<p>dreadful blunder; fortunately, she returned to the treasure box.</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (86 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p> From the bathroom, where it took me quite a time to shift back into</p>
<p>normal gear for a humdrum purpose, I heard, standing, drumming, retaining my</p>
<p>breath, my Lolita&#x2019;s &#x201C;oo&#x2019;s&#x201D; and &#x201C;gee&#x2019;s&#x201D; of girlish delight.</p>
<p> She had used the soap only because it was sample soap.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Well, come on, my dear, if you are as hungry as I am.&#x201D;</p>
<p> And so to the elevator, daughter swinging her old white purse, father</p>
<p>walking in front (nota bene: never behind, she is not a lady). As we stood</p>
<p>(now side by side) waiting to be taken down, she threw back her head, yawned</p>
<p>without restraint and shook her curls.</p>
<p> &#x201C;When did they make you get up at that camp?&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Half-past&#x2013;&#x201D; she stifled another yawn&#x2013;&#x201D;six&#x201D;&#x2013;yawn in full with a</p>
<p>shiver of all her frame. &#x201C;Half-past,&#x201D; she repeated, her throat filling up</p>
<p>again.</p>
<p> The dining room met us with a smell of fried fat and a faded smile. It</p>
<p>was a spacious and pretentious place with maudlin murals depicting enchanted</p>
<p>hunters in various postures and states of enchantment amid a medley of</p>
<p>pallid animals, dryads and trees. A few scattered old ladies, two clergymen,</p>
<p>and a man in a sports coat were finishing their meals in silence. The dining</p>
<p>room closed at nine, and the green-clad, poker-faced serving girls were,</p>
<p>happily, in a desperate hurry to get rid of us.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Does not he look exactly, but exactly, like Quilty?&#x201D; said Lo in a soft</p>
<p>voice, her sharp brown elbow not pointing, but visibly burning to point, at</p>
<p>the lone diner in the loud checks, in the far corner of the room.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Like our fat Ramsdale dentist?&#x201D;</p>
<p> Lo arrested the mouthful of water she had just taken, and put down her</p>
<p>dancing glass.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Course not,&#x201D; she said with a splutter of mirth. &#x201C;I meant the writer</p>
<p>fellow in the Dromes ad.&#x201D;</p>
<p> Oh, Fame! Oh, Femina!</p>
<p> When the dessert was plunked down&#x2013;a huge wedge of cherry pie for the</p>
<p>young lady and vanilla ice cream her protector, most of which she</p>
<p>expeditiously added to her pie&#x2013;I produced a small vial containing Papa&#x2019;s</p>
<p>Purple Pills. As I look back at those seasick murals, at that strange and</p>
<p>monstrous moment, I can only explain my behavior then by the mechanism of</p>
<p>that dream vacuum wherein revolves a deranged mind; but at the time, it all</p>
<p>seemed quite simple and inevitable to me. I glanced around, satisfied myself</p>
<p>that the last diner had left, removed the stopped, and with the utmost</p>
<p>deliberation tipped the philter into my palm. I had carefully rehearsed</p>
<p>before a mirror the gesture of clapping my empty hand to my open mouth and</p>
<p>swallowing a (fictitious) pill. As I expected, she pounced upon the vial</p>
<p>with its plump, beautifully colored capsules loaded with Beauty&#x2019;s Sleep.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Blue!&#x201D; she exclaimed. &#x201C;Violet blue. What are they made of?&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Summer skies,&#x201D; I said, &#x201C;and plums and figs, and the grapeblood of</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (87 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>emperors.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;No, seriously&#x2013;please.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Oh, just purpills. Vitamin X. Makes one strong as an ox or an ax. Want</p>
<p>to try one?&#x201D;</p>
<p> Lolita stretched out her hand, nodding vigorously.</p>
<p> I had hoped the drug would work fast. It certainly did. She had had a</p>
<p>long long day, she had gone rowing in the morning with Barbara whose sister</p>
<p>was Waterfront Director, as the adorable accessible nymphet now started to</p>
<p>tell me in between suppressed palate-humping yawns, growing in volume&#x2013;oh,</p>
<p>how fast the magic potion worked!&#x2013;and had been active in other ways too.</p>
<p>The movie that had vaguely loomed in her mind was, of course, by the time we</p>
<p>watertreaded out of the dining room, forgotten. As we stood in the elevator,</p>
<p>she leaned against me, faintly smiling&#x2013;wouldn&#x2019;t you like me to tell</p>
<p>you&#x2013;half closing her dark-lidded eyes. &#x201C;Sleepy, huh?&#x201D; said Uncle Tom who</p>
<p>was bringing up the quiet Franco-Irish gentleman and his daughter as well as</p>
<p>two withered women, experts in roses. They looked with sympathy at my frail,</p>
<p>tanned, tottering, dazed rosedarling. I had almost to carry her into our</p>
<p>room. There, she sat down on the edge of the bed, swaying a little, speaking</p>
<p>in dove-dull, long-drawn tones.</p>
<p> &#x201C;If I tell you&#x2013;if I tell you, will you promise [sleepy, so</p>
<p>sleepy&#x2013;head lolling, eyes going out], promise you won&#x2019;t make complaints?&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Later, Lo. Now go to bed. I&#x2019;ll leave you here, and you go to bed. Give</p>
<p>you ten minutes.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Oh, I&#x2019;ve been such a disgusting girl,&#x201D; she went on, shaking her hair,</p>
<p>removing with slow fingers a velvet hair ribbon. &#x201C;Lemme tell you&#x2013;&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Tomorrow, Lo. Go to bed, go to bed&#x2013;for goodness sake, to bed.&#x201D;</p>
<p> I pocketed the key and walked downstairs.</p>
<p> 28</p>
<p> Gentlewomen of the jury! Bear with me! Allow me to take just a tiny bit</p>
<p>of your precious time. So this was le grand moment. I had left my</p>
<p>Lolita still sitting on the edge of the abysmal bed, drowsily raising her</p>
<p>foot, fumbling at the shoelaces and showing as she did so the nether side of</p>
<p>her thigh up to the crotch of her panties&#x2013;she had always been singularly</p>
<p>absentminded, or shameless, or both, in matters of legshow. This, then, was</p>
<p>the hermetic vision of her which I had locked in&#x2013;after satisfying myself</p>
<p>that the door carried no inside bolt. The key, with its numbered dangler of</p>
<p>carved wood, became forthwith the weighty sesame to a rapturous and</p>
<p>formidable future. It was mine, it was part of my hot hairy fist. In a few</p>
<p>minutes&#x2013;say, twenty, say half-an-hour, sicher ist sicher as my uncle</p>
<p>Gustave used to say&#x2013;I would let myself into that &#x201C;342&#x201D; and find my nymphet,</p>

<p>my beauty and bride, imprisoned in her crystal sleep. Jurors! If my</p>
<p>happiness could have talked, it would have filled that genteel hotel with a</p>
<p>deafening roar. And my only regret today is that I did not quietly deposit</p>
<p>key &#x201C;342&#x201D; at the office, and leave the town, the country, the continent, the</p>
<p>hemisphere,&#x2013;indeed, the globe&#x2013;that very same night.</p>
<p> Let me explain. I was not unduly disturbed by her self-accusatory</p>
<p>innuendoes. I was still firmly resolved to pursue my policy of sparing her</p>
<p>purity by operating only in the stealth of night, only upon a completely</p>
<p>anesthetized little nude. Restraint and reverence were still my motto-even</p>
<p>if that &#x201C;purity&#x201D; (incidentally, thoroughly debunked by modern science) had</p>
<p>been slightly damaged through some juvenile erotic experience, no doubt</p>
<p>homosexual, at that accursed camp of hers. Of course, in my old-fashioned,</p>
<p>old-world way, I, Jean-Jacques Humbert, had taken for granted, when I first</p>
<p>met her, that she was as unravished as the stereotypical notion of &#x201C;normal</p>
<p>child&#x201D; had been since the lamented end of the Ancient World B.C. and its</p>
<p>fascinating practices. We are not surrounded in our enlightened era by little</p>
<p>slave flowers that can be casually plucked between business and bath as they</p>
<p>used to be in the days of the Romans; and we do not, as dignified Orientals</p>
<p>did in still more luxurious times, use tiny entertainers fore and aft</p>
<p>between the mutton and the rose sherbet. The whole point is that the old</p>
<p>link between the adult world and the child world has been completely severed</p>
<p>nowadays by new customs and new laws. Despite my having dabbled in</p>
<p>psychiatry and social work, I really knew very little about children. After</p>
<p>all, Lolita was only twelve, and no matter what concessions I made to time</p>
<p>and place&#x2013;even bearing in mind the crude behavior of American</p>
<p>schoolchildren&#x2013;I still was under the impression that whatever went on among</p>
<p>those brash brats, went on at a later age, and in a different environment.</p>
<p>Therefore (to retrieve the thread of this explanation) the moralist in me</p>
<p>by-passed the issue by clinging to conventional notions of what</p>
<p>twelve-year-old girls should be. The child therapist in me (a fake, as most</p>
<p>of them are&#x2013;but no matter) regurgitated neo-Freudian hash and conjured up a</p>
<p>dreaming and exaggerating Dolly in the &#x201C;latency&#x201D; period of girlhood.</p>
<p>Finally, the sensualist in me (a great and insane monster) had no objection</p>
<p>to some depravity in his prey. But somewhere behind the raging bliss,</p>
<p>bewildered shadows conferred&#x2013;and not to have heeded them, this is what I</p>
<p>regret! Human beings, attend! I should have understood that Lolita had</p>
<p>already proved to be something quite different from innocent Annabel,</p>
<p>and that the nymphean evil breathing through every pore of the fey child</p>
<p>that I had prepared for my secret delectation, would make the secrecy</p>
<p>impossible, and the delectation lethal. I should have known (by the signs</p>
<p>made to me by something in Lolita&#x2013;the real child Lolita or some haggard</p>
<p>angel behind her back) that nothing but pain and horror would result from</p>
<p>the expected rapture. Oh, winged gentlemen of the jury!</p>

<p> And she was mine, she was mine, the key was in my fist, my fist was in</p>
<p>my pocket, she was mine. In the course of evocations and schemes to which I</p>
<p>had dedicated so many insomnias, I had gradually eliminated all the</p>
<p>superfluous blur, and by stacking level upon level of translucent vision,</p>
<p>had evolved a final picture. Naked, except for one sock and her charm</p>
<p>bracelet, spread-eagled on the bed where my philter had felled her&#x2013;so I</p>
<p>foreglimpsed her; a velvet hair ribbon was still clutched in her hand; her</p>
<p>honey-brown body, with the white negative image of a rudimentary swimsuit</p>
<p>patterned against her tan, presented to me its pale breastbuds; in the rosy</p>
<p>lamplight, a little pubic floss glistened on its plump hillock. The cold key</p>
<p>with its warm wooden addendum was in my pocket.</p>
<p> I wandered through various public rooms, glory below, gloom above: for</p>
<p>the look of lust always is gloomy; lust is never quite sure&#x2013;even when the</p>
<p>velvety victim is locked up in one&#x2019;s dungeon&#x2013;that some rival devil or</p>
<p>influential god may still not abolish one&#x2019;s prepared triumph. In common</p>
<p>parlance, I needed a drink; but there was no barroom in that venerable place</p>
<p>full of perspiring philistines and period objects.</p>
<p> I drifted to the Men&#x2019;s Room. There, a person in the clerical black&#x2013;a</p>
<p>&#x201C;hearty party&#x201D; comme on dit&#x2013;checking with the assistance of Vienna,</p>
<p>if it was still there, inquired of me how I had liked Dr. Boyd&#x2019;s talk, and</p>
<p>looked puzzled when I (King Sigmund the Second) said Boyd was quite a boy.</p>
<p>Upon which, I neatly chucked the tissue paper I had been wiping my sensitive</p>
<p>finger tips with into the receptacle provided for it, and sallied lobbyward.</p>
<p>Comfortably resting my elbows on the counter, I asked Mr. Potts was he quite</p>
<p>sure my wife had not telephoned, and what about that cot? He answered she</p>
<p>had not (she was dead, of course) and the cot would be installed tomorrow if</p>
<p>we decided to stay on. From a big crowded place called The Hunters&#x2019; Hall</p>
<p>came a sound of many voices discussing horticulture or eternity. Another</p>
<p>room, called The Raspberry Room, all bathed in light, with bright little</p>
<p>tables and a large one with &#x201C;refreshments,&#x201D; was still empty except for a</p>
<p>hostess (that type of worn woman with a glassy smile and Charlotte&#x2019;s manner</p>
<p>of speaking); she floated up to me to ask if I was Mr. Braddock, because if</p>
<p>so, Miss Beard had been looking for me. &#x201C;What a name for a woman,&#x201D; I said</p>
<p>and strolled away.</p>
<p> In and out of my heart flowed my rainbow blood. I would give her till</p>
<p>half-past-nine. Going back to the lobby, I found there a change: a number of</p>
<p>people in floral dresses or black cloth had formed little groups here and</p>
<p>there, and some elfish chance offered me the sight of a delightful child of</p>
<p>Lolita&#x2019;s age, in Lolita&#x2019;s type of frock, but pure white, and there was a</p>
<p>white ribbon in her black hair. She was not pretty, but she was a nymphet,</p>
<p>and her ivory pale legs and lily neck formed for one memorable moment a most</p>
<p>pleasurable antiphony (in terms of spinal music) to my desire for Lolita,</p>
<p>brown and pink, flushed and fouled. The pale child noticed my gaze (which</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (90 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>was really quite casual and debonair), and being ridiculously</p>
<p>self-conscious, lost countenance completely, rolling her eyes and putting</p>
<p>the back of her hand to her cheek, and pulling at the hem of her skirt, and</p>
<p>finally turning her thin mobile shoulder blades to me in specious chat with</p>
<p>her cow-like mother.</p>
<p> I left the loud lobby and stood outside, on the white steps, looking at</p>
<p>the hundreds of powdered bugs wheeling around the lamps in the soggy black</p>
<p>night, full of ripple and stir. All I would do&#x2013;all I would dare do&#x2013;would</p>
<p>amount to such a trifle . . . Suddenly I was aware that in the darkness next</p>
<p>to me there was somebody sitting in a chair on the pillared porch. I could</p>
<p>not really see him but what gave him away was the rasp of a screwing off,</p>
<p>then a discreet gurgle, then the final note of a placid screwing on. I was</p>
<p>about to move away when his voice addressed me:</p>
<p> &#x201C;Where the devil did you get her?&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;I beg your pardon?&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;I said: the weather is getting better.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Seems so.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Who&#x2019;s the lassie?&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;My daughter.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;You lie&#x2013;she&#x2019;s not.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;I beg your pardon?&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;I said: July was hot. Where&#x2019;s her mother?&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Dead.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;I see. Sorry. By the way, why don&#x2019;t you two lunch with me tomorrow.</p>
<p>That dreadful crowd will be gone by then.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;We&#x2019;ll be gone too. Good night.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Sorry. I&#x2019;m pretty drunk. Good night. That child of yours needs a lot</p>
<p>of sleep. Sleep is a rose, as the Persians say. Smoke?&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Not now.&#x201D;</p>
<p> He struck a light, but because he was drunk, or because the wind was,</p>
<p>the flame illumined not him but another person, a very old man, one of those</p>
<p>permanent guests of old hotels&#x2013;and his white rocker. Nobody said anything</p>
<p>and the darkness returned to its initial place. Then I heard the old-timer</p>
<p>cough and deliver himself of some sepulchral mucus.</p>
<p> I left the porch. At least half an hour in all had elapsed. I ought to</p>
<p>have asked for a sip. The strain was beginning to tell. If a violin string</p>
<p>can ache, then I was that string. But it would have been unseemly to display</p>
<p>any hurry. As I made my way through a constellation of fixed people in one</p>
<p>corner of the lobby, there came a blinding flash&#x2013;and beaming Dr. Braddock,</p>
<p>two orchid-ornamentalized matrons, the small girl in white, and presumably</p>
<p>the bared teeth of Humbert Humbert sidling between the bridelike lassie and</p>
<p>the enchanted cleric, were immortalized&#x2013;insofar as the texture and print of</p>
<p>small-town newspapers can be deemed immortal. A twittering group had</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (91 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>gathered near the elevator. I again chose the stairs. 342 was near the fire</p>
<p>escape. One could still&#x2013;but the key was already in the lock, and then I was</p>
<p>in the room.</p>
<p> 29</p>
<p> The door of the lighted bathroom stood ajar; in addition to that, a</p>
<p>skeleton glow came though the Venetian blind from the outside arclights;</p>
<p>these intercrossed rays penetrated the darkness of the bedroom and revealed</p>
<p>the following situation.</p>
<p> Clothed in one of her old nightgowns, my Lolita lay on her side with</p>
<p>her back to me, in the middle of the bed. Her lightly veiled body and bare</p>
<p>limbs formed a Z. She had put both pillows under her dark tousled head; a</p>
<p>band of pale light crossed her top vertebrae.</p>
<p> I seemed to have shed my clothes and slipped into pajamas with the kind</p>
<p>of fantastic instantaneousness which is implied when in a cinematographic</p>
<p>scene the process of changing is cut; and I had already placed my knee on</p>
<p>the edge of the bed when Lolita turned her head and stared at me though the</p>
<p>striped shadows.</p>
<p> Now this was something the intruder had not expected. The whole</p>
<p>pill-spiel (a rather sordid affair, entre nous soit dit) had had for</p>
<p>object a fastness of sleep that a whole regiment would not have disturbed,</p>
<p>and here she was staring at me, and thickly calling me &#x201C;Barbara.&#x201D; Barbara,</p>
<p>wearing my pajamas which were much too tight for her, remained poised</p>
<p>motionless over the little sleep-talker. Softly, with a hopeless sigh, Dolly</p>
<p>turned away, resuming her initial position. For at least two minutes I</p>
<p>waited and strained on the brink, like that tailor with his homemade</p>
<p>parachute forty years ago when about to jump from the Eiffel Tower. Her</p>
<p>faint breathing had the rhythm of sleep. Finally I heaved myself onto my</p>
<p>narrow margin of bed, stealthily pulled at the odds and ends of sheets piled</p>
<p>up to the south of my stone-cold heels&#x2013;and Lolita lifted her head and gaped</p>
<p>at me.</p>
<p> As I learned later from a helpful pharmaceutist, the purple pill did</p>
<p>not even belong to the big and noble family of barbiturates, and though it</p>
<p>might have induced sleep in a neurotic who believed it to be a potent drug,</p>
<p>it was too mild a sedative to affect for any length of time a wary, albeit</p>
<p>weary, nymphet. Whether the Ramsdale doctor was a charlatan or a shrewd old</p>
<p>rogue, does not, and did not, really matter. What mattered, was that I had</p>
<p>been deceived. When Lolita opened her eyes again, I realized that whether or</p>
<p>not the drug might work later in the night, the security I had relied upon</p>
<p>was a sham one. Slowly her head turned away and dropped onto her unfair</p>
<p>amount of pillow. I lay quite still on my brink, peering at her rumpled</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (92 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>hair, at the glimmer of nymphet flesh, where half a haunch and half a</p>
<p>shoulder dimly showed, and trying to gauge the depth of her sleep by the</p>
<p>rate of her respiration. Some time passed, nothing changed, and I decided I</p>
<p>might risk getting a little closer to that lovely and maddening glimmer; but</p>
<p>hardly had I moved into its warm purlieus than her breathing was suspended,</p>
<p>and I had the odious feeling that little Dolores was wide awake and would</p>
<p>explode in screams if I touched her with any part of my wretchedness.</p>
<p>Please, reader: no matter your exasperation with the tenderhearted, morbidly</p>
<p>sensitive, infinitely circumspect hero of my book, do not skip these</p>
<p>essential pages! Imagine me; I shall not exist if you do not imagine me; try</p>
<p>to discern the doe in me, trembling in the forest of my own iniquity; let&#x2019;s</p>
<p>even smile a little. After all, there is no harm in smiling. For instance (I</p>
<p>almost wrote &#x201C;frinstance&#x201D;), I had no place to rest my head, and a fit of</p>
<p>heartburn (they call those fries &#x201C;French,&#x201D; grand Dieu!) was added to</p>
<p>my discomfort.</p>
<p> She was again fast asleep, my nymphet, but still I did not dare to</p>
<p>launch upon my enchanted voyage. La Petite Dormeuse ou l&#x2019;Amant</p>
<p>Ridicule. Tomorrow I would stuff her with those earlier pills that had</p>
<p>so thoroughly numbed her mummy. In the glove compartment&#x2013;or in the</p>
<p>Gladstone bag? Should I wait a solid hour and then creep up again? The</p>
<p>science of nympholepsy is a precise science. Actual contact would do it in</p>
<p>one second flat. An interspace of a millimeter would do it in ten. Let us</p>
<p>wait.</p>
<p> There is nothing louder than an American hotel; and, mind you, this was</p>
<p>supposed to be a quiet, cozy, old-fashioned, homey place&#x2013;&#x201D;gracious living&#x201D;</p>
<p>and all that stuff. The clatter of the elevator&#x2019;s gate&#x2013;some twenty yards</p>
<p>northeast of my head but as clearly perceived as if it were inside my left</p>
<p>temple&#x2013;alternated with the banging and booming of the machine&#x2019;s various</p>
<p>evolutions and lasted well beyond midnight. Every now and then, immediately</p>
<p>east of my left ear (always assuming I lay on my back, not daring to direct</p>
<p>my viler side toward the nebulous haunch of my bed-mate), the corridor would</p>
<p>brim with cheerful, resonant and inept exclamations ending in a volley of</p>
<p>good-nights. When that stopped, a toilet immediately north of my</p>
<p>cerebellum took over. It was a manly, energetic, deep-throated toilet, and</p>
<p>it was used many times. Its gurgle and gush and long afterflow shook the</p>
<p>wall behind me. Then someone in a southern direction was extravagantly sick,</p>
<p>almost coughing out his life with his liquor, and his toilet descended like</p>
<p>a veritable Niagara, immediately beyond our bathroom. And when finally all</p>
<p>the waterfalls had stopped, and the enchanted hunters were sound asleep, the</p>
<p>avenue under the window of my insomnia, to the west of my wake&#x2013;a staid,</p>
<p>eminently residential, dignified alley of huge trees&#x2013;degenerated into the</p>
<p>despicable haunt of gigantic trucks roaring through the wet and windy night.</p>
<p> And less than six inches from me and my burning life, was nebulous</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (93 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>Lolita! After a long stirless vigil, my tentacles moved towards her again,</p>
<p>and this time the creak of the mattress did not awake her. I managed to</p>
<p>bring my ravenous bulk so close to her that I felt the aura of her bare</p>
<p>shoulder like a warm breath upon my cheek. And then, she sat up, gasped,</p>
<p>muttered with insane rapidity something about boats, tugged at the sheets</p>
<p>and lapsed back into her rich, dark, young unconsciousness. As she tossed,</p>
<p>within that abundant flow of sleep, recently auburn, at present lunar, her</p>
<p>arm struck me across the face. For a second I held her. She freed herself</p>
<p>from the shadow of my embrace&#x2013;doing this not consciously, not violently,</p>
<p>not with any personal distaste, but with the neutral plaintive murmur of a</p>
<p>child demanding its natural rest. And again the situation remained the same:</p>
<p>Lolita with her curved spine to Humbert, Humbert resting his head on his</p>
<p>hand and burning with desire and dyspepsia.</p>
<p> The latter necessitated a trip to the bathroom for a draft of water</p>
<p>which is the best medicine I know in my case, except perhaps milk with</p>
<p>radishes; and when I re-entered the strange pale-striped fastness where</p>
<p>Lolita&#x2019;s old and new clothes reclined in various attitudes of enchantment on</p>
<p>pieces of furniture that seemed vaguely afloat, my impossible daughter sat</p>
<p>up and in clear tones demanded a drink, too. She took the resilient and cold</p>
<p>paper cup in her shadowy hand and gulped down its contents gratefully, her</p>
<p>long eyelashes pointing cupward, and then, with an infantile gesture that</p>
<p>carried more charm than any carnal caress, little Lolita wiped her lips</p>
<p>against my shoulder. She fell back on her pillow (I had subtracted mine</p>
<p>while she drank) and was instantly asleep again.</p>
<p> I had not dared offer her a second helping of the drug, and had not</p>
<p>abandoned hope that the first might still consolidate her sleep. I started</p>
<p>to move toward her, ready for any disappointment, knowing I had better wait</p>
<p>but incapable of waiting. My pillow smelled of her hair. I moved toward my</p>
<p>glimmering darling, stopping or retreating every time I thought she stirred</p>
<p>or was about to stir. A breeze from wonderland had begun to affect my</p>
<p>thoughts, and now they seemed couched in italics, as if the surface</p>
<p>reflecting them were wrinkled by the phantasm of that breeze. Time and again</p>
<p>my consciousness folded the wrong way, my shuffling body entered the sphere</p>
<p>of sleep, shuffled out again, and once or twice I caught myself drifting</p>
<p>into a melancholy snore. Mists of tenderness enfolded mountains of longing.</p>
<p>Now and then it seemed to me that the enchanted prey was about to meet</p>
<p>halfway the enchanted hunter, that her haunch was working its way toward me</p>
<p>under the soft sand of a remote and fabulous beach; and then her dimpled</p>
<p>dimness would stir, and I would know she was farther away from me than ever.</p>
<p> If I dwell at some length on the tremors and groupings of that distant</p>
<p>night, it is because I insist upon proving that I am not, and never was, and</p>
<p>never could have been, a brutal scoundrel. The gentle and dreamy regions</p>
<p>though which I crept were the patrimonies of poets&#x2013;not crime&#x2019;s</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (94 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>prowling ground. Had I reached my goal, my ecstasy would have been all</p>
<p>softness, a case of internal combustion of which she would hardly have felt</p>
<p>the heat, even if she were wide awake. But I still hoped she might gradually</p>
<p>be engulfed in a completeness of stupor that would allow me to taste more</p>
<p>than a glimmer of her. And so, in between tentative approximations, with a</p>
<p>confusion of perception metamorphosing her into eyespots of moonlight or a</p>
<p>fluffy flowering bush, I would dream I regained consciousness, dream I lay</p>
<p>in wait.</p>
<p> In the first antemeridian hours there was a lull in the restless hotel</p>
<p>night. Then around four the corridor toilet cascaded and its door banged. A</p>
<p>little after five a reverberating monologue began to arrive, in several</p>
<p>installments, from some courtyard or parking place. It was not really a</p>
<p>monologue, since the speaker stopped every few seconds to listen</p>
<p>(presumably) to another fellow, but that other voice did not reach me, and</p>
<p>so no real meaning could be derived from the part heard. Its matter-of-fact</p>
<p>intonations, however, helped to bring in the dawn, and the room was already</p>
<p>suffused with lilac gray, when several industrious toilets went to work, one</p>
<p>after the other, and the clattering and whining elevator began to rise and</p>
<p>take down early risers and downers, and for some minutes I miserably dozed,</p>
<p>and Charlotte was a mermaid in a greenish tank, and somewhere in the passage</p>
<p>Dr. Boyd said &#x201C;Good morning to you&#x201D; in a fruity voice, and birds were busy</p>
<p>in the trees, and then Lolita yawned.</p>
<p> Frigid gentlewomen of the jury! I had thought that months, perhaps</p>
<p>years, would elapse before I dared to reveal myself to Dolores Haze; but by</p>
<p>six she was wide awake, and by six fifteen we were technically lovers. I am</p>
<p>going to tell you something very strange: it was she who seduced me.</p>
<p> Upon hearing her first morning yawn, I feigned handsome profiled sleep.</p>
<p>I just did not know what to do. Would she be shocked at finding me by her</p>
<p>side, and not in some spare bed? Would she collect her clothes and lock</p>
<p>herself up in the bathroom? Would she demand to be taken at once to</p>
<p>Ramsdale&#x2013;to her mother&#x2019;s bedside&#x2013;back to camp? But my Lo was a sportive</p>
<p>lassie. I felt her eyes on me, and when she uttered at last that beloved</p>
<p>chortling note of hers, I knew her eyes had been laughing. She rolled over</p>
<p>to my side, and her warm brown hair came against my collarbone. I gave a</p>
<p>mediocre imitation of waking up. We lay quietly. I gently caressed her hair,</p>
<p>and we gently kissed. Her kiss, to my delirious embarrassment, had some</p>
<p>rather comical refinements of flutter and probe which made me conclude she</p>
<p>had been coached at an early age by a little Lesbian. No Charlie boy could</p>
<p>have taught her that. As if to see whether I had my fill and learned</p>
<p>the lesson, she drew away and surveyed me. Her cheekbones were flushed, her</p>
<p>full underlip glistened, my dissolution was near. All at once, with a burst</p>
<p>of rough glee (the sign of the nymphet!), she put her mouth to my ear&#x2013;but</p>
<p>for quite a while my mind could not separate into words the hot thunder of</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (95 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>her whisper, and she laughed, and brushed the hair off her face, and tried</p>
<p>again, and gradually the odd sense of living in a brand new, mad new dream</p>
<p>world, where everything was permissible, came over me as I realized what she</p>
<p>was suggesting. I answered I did not know what game she and Charlie had</p>
<p>played. &#x201C;You mean you have never&#x2013;?&#x201D;&#x2013;her features twisted into a stare of</p>
<p>disgusted incredulity. &#x201C;You have never&#x2013;&#x201D; she started again. I took time out</p>
<p>by nuzzling her a little. &#x201C;Lay off, will you,&#x201D; she said with a twangy whine,</p>
<p>hastily removing her brown shoulder from my lips. (It was very curious the</p>
<p>way she considered&#x2013;and kept doing so for a long time&#x2013;all caresses except</p>
<p>kisses on the mouth or the stark act of love either &#x201C;romantic slosh&#x201D; or</p>
<p>&#x201C;abnormal&#x201D;.)</p>
<p> &#x201C;You mean,&#x201D; she persisted, now kneeling above me, &#x201C;you never did it</p>
<p>when you were a kid?&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Never,&#x201D; I answered quite truthfully.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Okay,&#x201D; said Lolita, &#x201C;here is where we start.&#x201D;</p>
<p> However, I shall not bore my learned readers with a detailed account of</p>
<p>Lolita&#x2019;s presumption. Suffice it to say that not a trace of modesty did I</p>
<p>perceive in this beautiful hardly formed young girl whom modern</p>
<p>co-education, juvenile mores, the campfire racket and so forth had utterly</p>
<p>and hopelessly depraved. She saw the stark act merely as part of a</p>
<p>youngster&#x2019;s furtive world, unknown to adults. What adults did for purposes</p>
<p>of procreation was no business of hers. My life was handled by little Lo in</p>
<p>an energetic, matter-of-fact manner as if it were an insensate gadget</p>
<p>unconnected with me. While eager to impress me with the world of tough kids,</p>
<p>she was not quite prepared for certain discrepancies between a kid&#x2019;s life</p>
<p>and mine. Pride alone prevented her from giving up; for, in my strange</p>
<p>predicament, I feigned supreme stupidity and had her have her way&#x2013;at least</p>
<p>while I could still bear it. But really these are irrelevant matters; I am</p>
<p>not concerned with so-called &#x201C;sex&#x201D; at all. Anybody can imagine those</p>
<p>elements of animality. A greater endeavor lures me on: to fix once for all</p>
<p>the perilous magic of nymphets.</p>
<p> 30</p>
<p> I have to tread carefully. I have to speak in a whisper. Oh you,</p>
<p>veteran crime reporter, you grave old usher, you once popular policeman, now</p>
<p>in solitary confinement after gracing that school crossing for years, you</p>
<p>wretched emeritus read to by a boy! It would never do, would it, to have you</p>
<p>fellows fall madly in love with my Lolita! had I been a painter, had the</p>
<p>management of The Enchanted Hunters lost its mind one summer day and</p>
<p>commissioned me to redecorate their dining room with murals of my own</p>
<p>making, this is what I might have thought up, let me list some fragments:</p>

<p> There would have been a lake. There would have been an arbor in</p>
<p>flame-flower. There would have been nature studies&#x2013;a tiger pursuing a bird</p>
<p>of paradise, a choking snake sheathing whole the flayed trunk of a shoat.</p>
<p>There would have been a sultan, his face expressing great agony (belied, as</p>
<p>it were, by his molding caress), helping a callypygean slave child to climb</p>
<p>a column of onyx. There would have been those luminous globules of gonadal</p>
<p>glow that travel up the opalescent sides of juke boxes. There would have</p>
<p>been all kinds of camp activities on the part of the intermediate group,</p>
<p>Canoeing, Coranting, Combing Curls in the lakeside sun. There would have</p>
<p>been poplars, apples, a suburban Sunday. There would have been a fire opal</p>
<p>dissolving within a ripple-ringed pool, a last throb, a last dab of color,</p>
<p>stinging red, smearing pink, a sigh, a wincing child.</p>
<p> 31</p>
<p> I am trying to describe these things not to relive them in my present</p>
<p>boundless misery, but to sort out the portion of hell and the portion of</p>
<p>heaven in that strange, awful, maddening world&#x2013;nymphet love. The beastly</p>
<p>and beautiful merged at one point, and it is that borderline I would like to</p>
<p>fix, and I feel I fail to do so utterly. Why?</p>
<p> The stipulation of the Roman law, according to which a girl may marry</p>
<p>at twelve, was adopted by the Church, and is still preserved, rather</p>
<p>tacitly, in some of the United States. And fifteen is lawful everywhere.</p>
<p>There is nothing wrong, say both hemispheres, when a brute of forty, blessed</p>
<p>by the local priest and bloated with drink, sheds his sweat-drenched finery</p>
<p>and thrusts himself up to the hilt into his youthful bride. &#x201C;In such</p>
<p>stimulating temperate climates [says an old magazine in this prison library]</p>
<p>as St. Louis, Chicago and Cincinnati, girls mature about the end of their</p>
<p>twelfth year.&#x201D; Dolores Haze was born less than three hundred miles from</p>
<p>stimulating Cincinnati. I have but followed nature. I am nature&#x2019;s faithful</p>
<p>hound. Why then this horror that I cannot shake off? Did I deprive her of</p>
<p>her flower? Sensitive gentlewomen of the jury, I was not even her first</p>
<p>lover.</p>
<p> 32</p>
<p> She told me the way she had been debauched. We ate flavorless mealy</p>
<p>bananas, bruised peaches and very palatable potato chips, and die</p>
<p>Kleine told me everything. Her voluble but disjointed account was</p>
<p>accompanied by many a droll moue. As I think I have already observed,</p>
<p>I especially remember one wry face on an &#x201C;ugh!&#x201D; basis: jelly-mouth distended</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (97 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>sideways and eyes rolled up in a routine blend of comic disgust, resignation</p>
<p>and tolerance for young frailty.</p>
<p> Her astounding tale started with an introductory mention of her</p>
<p>tent-mate of the previous summer, at another camp, a &#x201C;very select&#x201D; one as</p>
<p>she put it. That tent-mate (&#x201C;quite a derelict character,&#x201D; &#x201C;half-crazy,&#x201D; but</p>
<p>a &#x201C;swell kid&#x201D;) instructed her in various manipulations. At first, loyal Lo</p>
<p>refused to tell me her name.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Was it Grace Angel?&#x201D; I asked.</p>
<p> She shook her head. No, it wasn&#x2019;t it was the daughter of a big shot.</p>
<p>He&#x2013;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Was it perhaps Rose Carmine?&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;No, of course not. Her father&#x2013;&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Was it, then, Agnes Sheridan perchance?&#x201D;</p>
<p> She swallowed and shook her head&#x2013;and then did a double take.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Say, how come you know all those kids?&#x201D;</p>
<p> I explained.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Well,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;They are pretty bad, some of that school bunch, but</p>
<p>not that bad. If you have to know, her name was Elizabeth Talbot, she goes</p>
<p>now to a swanky private school, her father is an executive.&#x201D;</p>
<p> I recalled with a funny pang the frequency with which poor Charlotte</p>
<p>used to introduce into party chat such elegant tidbits as &#x201C;when my daughter</p>
<p>was out hiking last year with the Talbot girl.&#x201D;</p>
<p> I wanted to know if either mother learned of those sapphic diversions?</p>
<p> &#x201C;Gosh no,&#x201D; exhaled limp Lo mimicking dread and relief, pressing a</p>
<p>falsely fluttering hand to her chest.</p>
<p> I was more interested, however, in heterosexual experience. She had</p>
<p>entered the sixth grade at eleven, soon after moving to Ramsdale from the</p>
<p>Middle West. What did she mean by &#x201C;pretty bad&#x201D;?</p>
<p> Well, the Miranda twins had shared the same bed for years, and Donald</p>
<p>Scott, who was the dumbest boy in the school, had done it with Hazel Smith</p>
<p>in his uncle&#x2019;s garage, and Kenneth Knight&#x2013;who was the brightest&#x2013;used to</p>
<p>exhibit himself wherever and whenever he had a chance, and&#x2013;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Let us switch to Camp Q,&#x201D; I said. And presently I got the whole story.</p>
<p> Barbara Burke, a sturdy blond, two years older than Lo and by far the</p>
<p>camp&#x2019;s best swimmer, had a very special canoe which she shared with Lo</p>
<p>&#x201C;because I was the only other girl who could make Willow Island&#x201D; (some</p>
<p>swimming test, I imagine). Through July, every morning&#x2013;mark, reader, every</p>
<p>blessed morning&#x2013;Barbara and Lo would be helped to carry the boat to Onyx or</p>
<p>Eryx (two small lakes in the wood) by Charlie Holmes, the camp mistress&#x2019;</p>
<p>son, aged thirteen&#x2013;and the only human male for a couple of miles around</p>
<p>(excepting an old meek stone-deaf handyman, and a farmer in an old Ford who</p>
<p>sometimes sold the campers eggs as farmers will); every morning, oh my</p>
<p>reader, the three children would take a short cut through the beautiful</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (98 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>innocent forest brimming with all the emblems of youth, dew, birdsongs, and</p>
<p>at one point, among the luxuriant undergrowth, Lo would be left as sentinel,</p>
<p>while Barbara and the boy copulated behind a bush.</p>
<p> At first, Lo had refused &#x201C;to try what it was like,&#x201D; but curiosity and</p>
<p>camaraderie prevailed, and soon she and Barbara were doing it by turns with</p>
<p>the silent, coarse and surly but indefatigable Charlie, who had as much sex</p>
<p>appeal as a raw carrot but sported a fascinating collection of</p>
<p>contraceptives which he used to fish out of a third nearby lake, a</p>
<p>considerably larger and more populous one, called Lake Climax, after the</p>
<p>booming young factory town of that name. Although conceding it was &#x201C;sort of</p>
<p>fun&#x201D; and &#x201C;fine for the complexion,&#x201D; Lolita, I am glad to say, held Charlie&#x2019;s</p>
<p>mind and manners in the greatest contempt. Nor had her temperament been</p>
<p>roused by that filthy fiend. In fact, I think he had rather stunned it,</p>
<p>despite the &#x201C;fun.&#x201D;</p>
<p> By that time it was close to ten. With the ebb of lust, an ashen sense</p>
<p>of awfulness, abetted by the realistic drabness of a gray neuralgic day,</p>
<p>crept over me and hummed within my temples. Brown, naked, frail Lo, her</p>
<p>narrow white buttocks to me, her sulky face to a door mirror, stood, arms</p>
<p>akimbo, feet (in new slippers with pussy-fur tops) wide apart, and through a</p>
<p>forechanging lock tritely mugged at herself in the glass. From the corridor</p>
<p>came the cooing voices of colored maids at work, and presently there was a</p>
<p>mild attempt to open the door of our room. I had Lo go to the bathroom and</p>
<p>take a much-needed soap shower. The bed was a frightful mess with overtones</p>
<p>of potato chips. She tried on a two-piece navy wool, then a sleeveless</p>
<p>blouse with a swirly clathrate skirt, but the first was too tight and the</p>
<p>second too ample, and when I begged her to hurry up (the situation was</p>
<p>beginning to frighten me), Lo viciously sent those nice presents of mine</p>
<p>hurtling into a corner, and put on yesterday&#x2019;s dress. When she was ready at</p>
<p>last, I gave her a lovely new purse of simulated calf (in which I had</p>
<p>slipped quite a few pennies and two mint-bright dimes) and told her to buy</p>
<p>herself a magazine in the lobby.</p>
<p> &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll be down in a minute,&#x201D; I said. &#x201C;And if I were you, my dear, I</p>
<p>would not talk to strangers.&#x201D;</p>
<p> Except for my poor little gifts, there was not much to pack; but I was</p>
<p>forced to devote a dangerous amount of time (was she up to something</p>
<p>downstairs?) to arranging the bed in such a way as to suggest the abandoned</p>
<p>nest of a restless father and his tomboy daughter, instead of an</p>
<p>ex-convict&#x2019;s saturnalia with a couple of fat old whores. Then I finished</p>
<p>dressing and had the hoary bellboy come up for the bags.</p>
<p> Everything was fine. There, in the lobby, she sat, deep in an</p>
<p>overstuffed blood-red armchair, deep in a lurid movie magazine. A fellow of</p>
<p>my age in tweeds (the genre of the place had changed overnight to a spurious</p>
<p>country-squire atmosphere) was staring at my Lolita over his dead cigar and</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (99 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>stale newspaper. She wore her professional white socks and saddle oxfords,</p>
<p>and that bright print frock with the square throat; a splash of jaded</p>
<p>lamplight brought out the golden down on her warm brown limbs. There she</p>
<p>sat, her legs carelessly highcrossed, and her pale eyes skimming along the</p>
<p>lines with every now and then a blink. Bill&#x2019;s wife had worshipped him from</p>
<p>afar long before they ever met: in fact, she used to secretly admire the</p>
<p>famous young actor as he ate sundaes in Schwab&#x2019;s drugstore. Nothing could</p>
<p>have been more childish than her snubbed nose, freckled face or the purplish</p>
<p>spot on her naked neck where a fairytale vampire had feasted, or the</p>
<p>unconscious movement of her tongue exploring a touch of rosy rash around her</p>
<p>swollen lips; nothing could be more harmless than to read about Jill, an</p>
<p>energetic starlet who made her own clothes and was a student of serious</p>
<p>literature; nothing could be more innocent than the part in that glossy</p>
<p>brown hair with that silky sheen on the temple; nothing could be more</p>
<p>naive&#x2013;But what sickening envy the lecherous fellow whoever he was&#x2013;come to</p>
<p>think of it, he resembled a little my Swiss uncle Gustave, also a great</p>
<p>admirer of le d&#xE8;couvert&#x2013;would have experienced had he known that</p>
<p>every nerve in me was still anointed and ringed with the feel of her</p>
<p>body&#x2013;the body of some immortal demon disguised as a female child.</p>
<p> Was pink pig Mr. Swoon absolutely sure my wife had not telephoned? He</p>
<p>was. If she did, would he tell her we had gone on to Aunt Clare&#x2019;s place? He</p>
<p>would, indeedie. I settled the bill and roused Lo from her chair. She read</p>
<p>to the car. Still reading, she was driven to a so-called coffee shop a few</p>
<p>blocks south. Oh, she ate all right. She even laid aside her magazine to</p>
<p>eat, but a queer dullness had replaced her usual cheerfulness. I knew little</p>
<p>Lo could be very nasty, so I braced myself and grinned, and waited for a</p>
<p>squall. I was unbathed, unshaven, and had had no bowel movement. My nerves</p>
<p>were a-jangle. I did not like the way my little mistress shrugged her</p>
<p>shoulders and distended her nostrils when I attempted casual small talk. Had</p>
<p>Phyllis been in the know before she joined her parents in Maine? I asked</p>
<p>with a smile. &#x201C;Look,&#x201D; said Lo making a weeping grimace, &#x201C;let us get off the</p>
<p>subject.&#x201D; I then tried&#x2013;also unsuccessfully, no matter how I smacked my</p>
<p>lips&#x2013;to interest her in the road map. Our destination was, let me remind my</p>
<p>patient reader whose meek temper Lo ought to have copied, the gay town of</p>
<p>Lepingville, somewhere near a hypothetical hospital. That destination was in</p>
<p>itself a perfectly arbitrary one (as, alas, so many were to be), and I shook</p>
<p>in my shoes as I wondered how to keep the whole arrangement plausible, and</p>
<p>what other plausible objectives to invent after we had taken in all the</p>
<p>movies in Lepingville. More and more uncomfortable did Humbert Feel. It was</p>
<p>something quite special, that feeling: an oppressive, hideous constraint as</p>
<p>if I were sitting with the small ghost of somebody I had just killed.</p>
<p> As she was in the act of getting back into the car, an expression of</p>
<p>pain flitted across Lo&#x2019;s face. It flitted again, more meaningfully, as she</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (100 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>settled down beside me. No doubt, she reproduced it that second time for my</p>
<p>benefit. Foolishly, I asked her what was the matter. &#x201C;Nothing, you brute,&#x201D;</p>
<p>she replied. &#x201C;You what?&#x201D; I asked. She was silent. Leaving Briceland.</p>
<p>Loquacious Lo was silent. Cold spiders of panic crawled down my back. This</p>
<p>was an orphan. This was a lone child, an absolute waif, with whom a</p>
<p>heavy-limbed, foul-smelling adult had had strenuous intercourse three times</p>
<p>that very morning. Whether or not the realization of a lifelong dream had</p>
<p>surpassed all expectation, it had, in a sense, overshot its mark&#x2013;and</p>
<p>plunged into a nightmare. I had been careless, stupid, and ignoble. And let</p>
<p>me be quite frank: somewhere at the bottom of that dark turmoil I felt the</p>
<p>writhing of desire again, so monstrous was my appetite for that miserable</p>
<p>nymphet. Mingled with the pangs of guilt was the agonizing through that her</p>
<p>mood might prevent me from making love to her again as soon as I found a</p>
<p>nice country road where to park in peace. In other words, poor Humbert</p>
<p>Humbert was dreadfully unhappy, and while steadily and inanely driving</p>
<p>toward Lepingville, he kept racking his brains for some quip, under the</p>
<p>bright wing of which he might dare turn to his seatmate. It was she,</p>
<p>however, who broke the silence:</p>
<p> &#x201C;Oh, a squashed squirrel,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;What a shame.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Yes, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201D; (eager, hopeful Hum).</p>
<p> &#x201C;Let us stop at the next gas station,&#x201D; Lo continued. &#x201C;I want to go to</p>
<p>the washroom.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;We shall stop wherever you want,&#x201D; I said. And then as a lovely,</p>
<p>lonely, supercilious grove (oaks, I thought; American trees at that stage</p>
<p>were beyond me) started to echo greenly the rush of our car, a red and ferny</p>
<p>road on our right turned its head before slanting into the woodland, and I</p>
<p>suggested we might perhaps&#x2013;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Drive on,&#x201D; my Lo cried shrilly.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Righto. Take it easy.&#x201D; (Down, poor beast, down.)</p>
<p> I glanced at her. Thank God, the child was smiling.</p>
<p> &#x201C;You chump,&#x201D; she said, sweetly smiling at me. &#x201C;You revolting creature.</p>
<p>I was a daisy-fresh girl, and look what you&#x2019;ve done to me. I ought to call</p>
<p>the police and tell them you raped me. Oh, you dirty, dirty old man.&#x201D;</p>
<p> Was she just joking? An ominous hysterical note rang through her silly</p>
<p>words. Presently, making a sizzling sound with her lips, she started</p>
<p>complaining of pains, said she could not sit, said I had torn something</p>
<p>inside her. The sweat rolled down my neck, and we almost ran over some</p>
<p>little animal or other that was crossing the road with tail erect, and again</p>
<p>my vile-tempered companion called me an ugly name. When we stopped at the</p>
<p>filling station, she scrambled out without a word and was a long time away.</p>
<p>Slowly, lovingly, an elderly friend with a broken nose wiped my</p>
<p>windshield&#x2013;they do it differently at every place, from chamois cloth to</p>
<p>soapy brush, this fellow used a pink sponge.</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (101 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p> She appeared at last. &#x201C;Look,&#x201D; she said in that neutral voice that hurt</p>
<p>me so, &#x201C;give me some dimes and nickels. I want to call mother in that</p>
<p>hospital. What&#x2019;s the number?&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Get in,&#x201D; I said. &#x201C;You can&#x2019;t call that number.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Why?&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Get in and slam the door.&#x201D;</p>
<p> She got in and slammed the door. The old garage man beamed at her. I</p>
<p>swung onto the highway.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Why can&#x2019;t I call my mother if I want to?&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Because,&#x201D; I answered, &#x201C;your mother is dead.&#x201D;</p>
<p> 33</p>
<p> In the gay town of Lepingville I bought her four books of comics, a box</p>
<p>of candy, a box of sanitary pads, two cokes, a manicure set, a travel clock</p>
<p>with a luminous dial, a ring with a real topaz, a tennis racket, roller</p>
<p>skates with white high shoes, field glasses, a portable radio set, chewing</p>
<p>gum, a transparent raincoat, sunglasses, some more garments&#x2013;swooners,</p>
<p>shorts, all kinds of summer frocks. At the hotel we had separate rooms, but</p>
<p>in the middle of the night she came sobbing into mine, and we made it up</p>
<p>very gently. You see, she had absolutely nowhere else to go.</p>
<p> * PART TWO * </p>
<p> 1</p>
<p> It was then that began our extensive travels all over the States. To</p>
<p>any other type of tourist accommodation I soon grew to prefer the Functional</p>
<p>Motel&#x2013;clean, neat, safe nooks, ideal places for sleep, argument,</p>
<p>reconciliation, insatiable illicit love. At first, in my dread of arousing</p>
<p>suspicion, I would eagerly pay for both sections of one double unit, each</p>
<p>containing a double bed. I wondered what type of foursome this arrangement</p>
<p>was even intended for, since only a pharisaic parody of privacy could be</p>
<p>attained by means of the incomplete partition dividing the cabin or room</p>
<p>into two communicating love nests. By and by, the very possibilities that</p>
<p>such honest promiscuity suggested (two young couples merrily swapping mates</p>
<p>or a child shamming sleep to earwitness primal sonorities) made me bolder,</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (102 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>and every now and then I would take a bed-and-cot or twin-bed cabin, a</p>
<p>prison cell or paradise, with yellow window shades pulled down to create a</p>
<p>morning illusion of Venice and sunshine when actually it was Pennsylvania</p>
<p>and rain.</p>
<p> We came to know&#x2013;nous conn&#xF8;mes, to use a Flaubertian</p>
<p>intonation&#x2013;the stone cottages under enormous Chateaubriandesque trees, the</p>
<p>brick unit, the adobe unit, the stucco court, on what the Tour Book of the</p>
<p>Automobile Association describes as &#x201C;shaded&#x201D; or &#x201C;spacious&#x201D; or &#x201C;landscaped&#x201D;</p>
<p>grounds. The log kind, finished in knotty pine, reminded Lo, by its</p>
<p>golden-brown glaze, of friend-chicken bones. We held in contempt the plain</p>
<p>whitewashed clapboard Kabins, with their faint sewerish smell or some other</p>
<p>gloomy self-conscious stench and nothing to boast of (except &#x201C;good beds&#x201D;),</p>
<p>and an unsmiling landlady always prepared to have her gift (&#x201C;. . . well, I</p>
<p>could give you . . .&#x201D;) turned down.</p>
<p> Nous conn&#xF8;mes (this is royal fun) the would-be enticements of</p>
<p>their repetitious names&#x2013;all those Sunset Motels, U-Beam Cottages, Hillcrest</p>
<p>Courts, Pine View Courts, Mountain View Courts, Skyline Courts, Park Plaza</p>
<p>Courts, Green Acres, Mac&#x2019;s Courts. There was sometimes a special line in the</p>
<p>write-up, such as &#x201C;Children welcome, pets allowed&#x201D; (You are welcome,</p>
<p>you are allowed). The baths were mostly tiled showers, with an</p>
<p>endless variety of spouting mechanisms, but with one definitely</p>
<p>non-Laodicean characteristic in common, a propensity, while in use, to turn</p>
<p>instantly beastly hot or blindingly cold upon you, depending on whether your</p>
<p>neighbor turned on his cold or his hot to deprive you of a necessary</p>
<p>complement in the shower you had so carefully blended. Some motels had</p>
<p>instructions pasted above the toilet (on whose tank the towels were</p>
<p>unhygienically heaped) asking guests not to throw into its bowl garbage,</p>
<p>beer cans, cartons, stillborn babies; others had special notices under</p>
<p>glass, such as Things to Do (Riding: You will often see riders coming</p>
<p>down Main Street on their way back from a romantic moonlight ride.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Often at 3 a.m.,&#x201D; sneered unromantic Lo).</p>
<p> Nous conn&#xF8;mes the various types of motor court operators, the</p>
<p>reformed criminal, the retired teacher and the business flop, among the</p>
<p>males; and the motherly, pseudo-ladylike and madamic variants among the</p>
<p>females. And sometimes trains would cry in the monstrously hot and humid</p>
<p>night with heartrending and ominous plangency, mingling power and hysteria</p>
<p>in one desperate scream.</p>
<p> We avoided Tourist Homes, country cousins of Funeral ones,</p>
<p>old-fashioned, genteel and showerless, with elaborate dressing tables in</p>
<p>depressingly white-and-pink little bedrooms, and photographs of the</p>
<p>landlady&#x2019;s children in all their instars. But I did surrender, now and then,</p>
<p>to Lo&#x2019;s predilection for &#x201C;real&#x201D; hotels. She would pick out in the book,</p>
<p>while I petted her in the parked car in the silence of a dusk-mellowed,</p>

<p>mysterious side-road, some highly recommended lake lodge which offered all</p>
<p>sorts of things magnified by the flashlight she moved over them, such as</p>
<p>congenial company, between-meals snacks, outdoor barbecues&#x2013;but which in my</p>
<p>mind conjured up odious visions of stinking high school boys in sweatshirts</p>
<p>and an ember-red cheek pressing against hers, while poor Dr. Humbert,</p>
<p>embracing nothing but two masculine knees, would cold-humor his piles on the</p>
<p>damp turf. Most empty to her, too, were those &#x201C;Colonial&#x201D; Inns, which apart</p>
<p>from &#x201C;gracious atmosphere&#x201D; and picture windows, promised &#x201C;unlimited</p>
<p>quantities of M-m-m food.&#x201D; Treasured recollections of my father&#x2019;s palatial</p>
<p>hotel sometimes led me to seek for its like in the strange country we</p>
<p>traveled through. I was soon discouraged; but Lo kept following the scent of</p>
<p>rich food ads, while I derived a not exclusively economic kick from such</p>
<p>roadside signs as Timber Hotel, Children under 14 Free. On the other</p>
<p>hand, I shudder when recalling that soi-disant &#x201C;high-class&#x201D; resort in</p>
<p>a Midwestern state, which advertised &#x201C;raid-the-icebox&#x201D; midnight snacks and,</p>
<p>intrigued by my accent, wanted to know my dead wife&#x2019;s and dead mother&#x2019;s</p>
<p>maiden names. A two-days&#x2019; stay there cost me a hundred and twenty-four</p>
<p>dollars! And do you remember, Miranda, that other &#x201C;ultrasmart&#x201D; robbers&#x2019; den</p>
<p>with complimentary morning coffee and circulating ice water, and no children</p>
<p>under sixteen (no Lolitas, of course)?</p>
<p> Immediately upon arrival at one of the plainer motor courts which</p>
<p>became our habitual haunts, she would set the electric fan a-whirr, or</p>
<p>induce me to drop a quarter into the radio, or she would read all the signs</p>
<p>and inquire with a whine why she could not go riding up some advertised</p>
<p>trail or swimming in that local pool of warm mineral water. Most often, in</p>
<p>the slouching, bored way she cultivated, Lo would fall prostrate and</p>
<p>abominably desirable into a red springchair or a green chaise longue, or a</p>
<p>steamer chair of striped canvas with footrest and canopy, or a sling chair,</p>
<p>or any other lawn chair under a garden umbrella on the patio, and it would</p>
<p>take hours of blandishments, threats and promises to make her lend me for a</p>
<p>few seconds her brown limbs in the seclusion of the five-dollar room before</p>
<p>undertaking anything she might prefer to my poor joy.</p>
<p> A combination of na&#xEE;vet&#xE8; and deception, of charm and vulgarity, of blue</p>
<p>silks and rosy mirth, Lolita, when she chose, could be a most exasperating</p>
<p>brat. I was not really quite prepared for her fits of disorganized boredom,</p>
<p>intense and vehement griping, her sprawling, droopy, dopey-eyed style, and</p>
<p>what is called goofing off&#x2013;a kind of diffused clowning which she thought</p>
<p>was tough in a boyish hoodlum way. Mentally, I found her to be a</p>
<p>disgustingly conventional little girl. Sweet hot jazz, square dancing, gooey</p>
<p>fudge sundaes, musicals, movie magazines and so forth&#x2013;these were the</p>
<p>obvious items in her list of beloved things. The Lord knows how many nickels</p>
<p>I fed to the gorgeous music boxes that came with every meal we had! I still</p>
<p>hear the nasal voices of those invisibles serenading her, people with names</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (104 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>like Sammy and Jo and Eddy and Tony and Peggy and Guy and Patty and Rex, and</p>
<p>sentimental song hits, all of them as similar to my ear as her various</p>
<p>candies were to my palate. She believed, with a kind of celestial trust, any</p>
<p>advertisement or advice that that appeared in Movie Love or Screen</p>
<p>Land&#x2013;Starasil Starves Pimples, or &#x201C;You better watch out if you&#x2019;re</p>
<p>wearing your shirttails outside your jeans, gals, because Jill says you</p>
<p>shouldn&#x2019;t.&#x201D; If a roadside sign said: Visit Our Gift Shop&#x2013;we had to</p>
<p>visit it, had to buy its Indian curios, dolls, copper jewelry, cactus</p>
<p>candy. The words &#x201C;novelties and souvenirs&#x201D; simply entranced her by their</p>
<p>trochaic lilt. If some caf&#xE8; sign proclaimed Icecold Drinks, she was</p>
<p>automatically stirred, although all drinks everywhere were ice-cold. She it</p>
<p>was to whom ads were dedicated: the ideal consumer, the subject and object</p>
<p>of every foul poster. And she attempted&#x2013;unsuccessfully-to patronize only</p>
<p>those restaurants where the holy spirit of Huncan Dines had descended upon</p>
<p>the cute paper napkins and cottage-cheese-crested salads.</p>
<p> In those days, neither she nor I had thought up yet the system of</p>
<p>monetary bribes which was to work such havoc with my nerves and her morals</p>
<p>somewhat later. I relied on three other methods to keep my pubescent</p>
<p>concubine in submission and passable temper. A few years before, she had</p>
<p>spent a rainy summer under Miss Phalen&#x2019;s bleary eye in a dilapidated</p>
<p>Appalachian farmhouse that had belonged to some gnarled Haze or other in the</p>
<p>dead past. It still stood among its rank acres of golden rod on the edge of</p>
<p>a flowerless forest, at the end of a permanently muddy road, twenty miles</p>
<p>from the nearest hamlet. Lo recalled that scarecrow of a house, the</p>
<p>solitude, the soggy old pastures, the wind, the bloated wilderness, with an</p>
<p>energy of disgust that distorted her mouth and fattened her half-revealed</p>
<p>tongue. And it was there that I warned her she would dwell with me in exile</p>
<p>for months and years if need be, studying under me French and Latin, unless</p>
<p>her &#x201C;present attitude&#x201D; changed. Charlotte, I began to understand you!</p>
<p> A simple child, Lo would scream no! and frantically clutch at my</p>
<p>driving hand whenever I put a stop to her tornadoes of temper by turning in</p>
<p>the middle of a highway with the implication that I was about to take her</p>
<p>straight to that dark and dismal abode. The farther, however, we traveled</p>
<p>away from it west, the less tangible that menace became, and I had to adopt</p>
<p>other methods of persuasion.</p>
<p> Among these, the reformatory threat is the one I recall with the</p>
<p>deepest moan of shame. From the very beginning of our concourse, I was</p>
<p>clever enough to realize that I must secure her complete co-operation in</p>
<p>keeping our relations secret, that it should become a second nature with</p>
<p>her, no matter what grudge she might bear me, no matter what other pleasure</p>
<p>she might seek.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Come and kiss your old man,&#x201D; I would say, &#x201C;and drop that moody</p>
<p>nonsense. In former times, when I was still your dream male [the reader will</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (105 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>notice what pains I took to speak Lo&#x2019;s tongue], you swooned to records of</p>
<p>the number one throb-and-sob idol of your coevals [Lo: &#x201C;Of my what? Speak</p>
<p>English&#x201D;]. That idol of your pals sounded, you thought, like friend Humbert.</p>
<p>But now, I am just your old man, a dream dad protecting his dream</p>
<p>daughter.</p>
<p> &#x201C;My ch&#xF5;re Dolor&#xE8;s ! I want to protect you, dear, from all the</p>
<p>horrors that happen to little girls in coal sheds and alley ways, and alas,</p>
<p>comme vous le savez trop bien, ma gentille, in the blueberry woods</p>
<p>during the bluest of summers. Through thick and thin I will still stay your</p>
<p>guardian, and if you are good, I hope a court may legalize that guardianship</p>
<p>before long. Let us, however, forget, Dolores Haze, so-called legal</p>
<p>terminology, terminology that accepts as rational the term &#x2018;lewd and</p>
<p>lascivious cohabitation.&#x2019; I am not a criminal sexual psychopath taking</p>
<p>indecent liberties with a child. The rapist was Charlie Holmes; I am the</p>
<p>therapist&#x2013;a matter of nice spacing in the way of distinction. I am your</p>
<p>daddum, Lo. Look, I&#x2019;ve a learned book here about young girls. Look, darling,</p>
<p>what it says. I quote: the normal girl&#x2013;normal, mark you&#x2013;the normal girl is</p>
<p>usually extremely anxious to please her father. She feels in him the</p>
<p>forerunner of the desired elusive male (&#x2018;elusive&#x2019; is good, by Polonius!).</p>
<p>The wise mother (and your poor mother would have been wise, had she lived)</p>
<p>will encourage a companionship between father and daughter,</p>
<p>realizing&#x2013;excuse the corny style&#x2013;that the girl forms her ideals of romance</p>
<p>and of men from her association with her father. Now, what association does</p>
<p>this cheery book mean&#x2013;and recommend? I quote again: Among Sicilians sexual</p>
<p>relations between a father and his daughter are accepted as a matter of</p>
<p>course, and the girl who participates in such relationship is not looked</p>
<p>upon with disapproval by the society of which she is part. I&#x2019;m a great</p>
<p>admirer of Sicilians, fine athletes, fine musicians, fine upright people,</p>
<p>Lo, and great lovers. But let&#x2019;s not digress. Only the other day we read in</p>
<p>the newspapers some bunkum about a middle-aged morals offender who pleaded</p>
<p>guilty to the violation of the Mann Act and to transporting a nine-year-old</p>
<p>girl across state lines for immoral purposes, whatever these are. Dolores</p>
<p>darling! You are not nine but almost thirteen, and I would not advise you to</p>
<p>consider yourself my cross-country slave, and I deplore the Mann Act as</p>
<p>lending itself to a dreadful pun, the revenge that the Gods of Semantics</p>
<p>take against tight-zippered Philistines. I am your father, and I am</p>
<p>speaking English, and I love you.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Finally, let us see what happens if you, a minor, accused of having</p>
<p>impaired the morals of an adult in a respectable inn, what happens if you</p>
<p>complain to the police of my having kidnapped and raped you? Let us suppose</p>
<p>they believe you. A minor female, who allows a person over twenty-one to</p>
<p>know her carnally, involves her victim into statutory rape, or second-degree</p>
<p>sodomy, depending on the technique; and the maximum penalty is ten years.</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (106 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>So, I go to jail. Okay. I go to jail. But what happens to you, my orphan?</p>
<p>Well, you are luckier. You become the ward of the Department of Public</p>
<p>Welfare&#x2013;which I am afraid sounds a little bleak. A nice grim matron of the</p>
<p>Miss Phalen type, but more rigid and not a drinking woman, will take away</p>
<p>your lipstick and fancy clothes. No more gadding about! I don&#x2019;t know if you</p>
<p>have ever heard of the laws relating to dependent, neglected, incorrigible</p>
<p>and delinquent children. While I stand gripping the bars, you, happy</p>
<p>neglected child, will be given a choice of various dwelling places, all more</p>
<p>or less the same, the correctional school, the reformatory, the juvenile</p>
<p>detention home, or one of those admirable girls&#x2019; protectories where you knit</p>
<p>things, and sing hymns, and have rancid pancakes on Sundays. You will go</p>
<p>there, Lolita&#x2013;my Lolita, this Lolita will leave plainer</p>
<p>words, if we two are found out, you will be analyzed and institutionalized,</p>
<p>my pet, c&#x2019;est tout. You will dwell, my Lolita will dwell (come here,</p>
<p>my brown flower) with thirty-nine other dopes in a dirty dormitory (no,</p>
<p>allow me, please) under the supervision of hideous matrons. This is the</p>
<p>situation, this is the choice. Don&#x2019;t you think that under the circumstances</p>
<p>Dolores Haze had better stick to her old man?&#x201D;</p>
<p> By rubbing all this in, I succeeded in terrorizing Lo, who despite a</p>
<p>certain brash alertness of manner and spurts of wit was not as intelligent a</p>
<p>child as her I.Q. might suggest. But if I managed to establish that</p>
<p>background of shared secrecy and shared guilt, I was much less successful in</p>
<p>keeping her in good humor. Every morning during our yearlong travels I had</p>
<p>to devise some expectation, some special point in space and time for her to</p>
<p>look forward to, for her to survive till bedtime. Otherwise, deprived of a</p>
<p>shaping and sustaining purpose, the skeleton of her day sagged and</p>
<p>collapsed. The object in view might be anything&#x2013;a lighthouse in Virginia, a</p>
<p>natural cave in Arkansas converted to a caf&#xE8;, a collection of guns and</p>
<p>violins somewhere in Oklahoma, a replica of the Grotto of Lourdes in</p>
<p>Louisiana, shabby photographs of the bonanza mining period in the local</p>
<p>museum of a Rocky Mountains resort, anything whatsoever&#x2013;but it had to be</p>
<p>there, in front of us, like a fixed star, although as likely as not Lo would</p>
<p>feign gagging as soon as we got to it.</p>
<p> By putting the geography of the United States into motion, I did my</p>
<p>best for hours on end to give her the impression of &#x201C;going places,&#x201D; of</p>
<p>rolling on to some definite destination, to some unusual delight. I have</p>
<p>never seen such smooth amiable roads as those that now radiated before us,</p>
<p>across the crazy quilt of forty-eight states. Voraciously we consumed those</p>
<p>long highways, in rapt silence we glided over their glossy black dance</p>
<p>floors. Not only had Lo no eye for scenery but she furiously resented my</p>
<p>calling her attention to this or that enchanting detail of landscape; which</p>
<p>I myself learned to discern only after being exposed for quite a time to the</p>
<p>delicate beauty ever present in the margin of our undeserving journey. By a</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (107 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>paradox of pictorial thought, the average lowland North-American countryside</p>
<p>had at first seemed to me something I accepted with a shock of amused</p>
<p>recognition because of those painted oilclothes which were imported from</p>
<p>America in the old days to be hung above washstands in Central-European</p>
<p>nurseries, and which fascinated a drowsy child at bed time with the rustic</p>
<p>green views they depicted&#x2013;opaque curly trees, a barn, cattle, a brook, the</p>
<p>dull white of vague orchards in bloom, and perhaps a stone fence or hills of</p>
<p>greenish gouache. But gradually the models of those elementary rusticities</p>
<p>became stranger and stranger to the eye, the nearer I came to know them.</p>
<p>Beyond the tilled plain, beyond the toy roofs, there would be a slow</p>
<p>suffusion of inutile loveliness, a low sun in a platinum haze with a warm,</p>
<p>peeled-peach tinge pervading the upper edge of a two-dimensional, dove-gray</p>
<p>cloud fusing with the distant amorous mist. There might be a line of spaced</p>
<p>trees silhouetted against the horizon, and hot still noons above a</p>
<p>wilderness of clover, and Claude Lorrain clouds inscribed remotely into</p>
<p>misty azure with only their cumulus part conspicuous against the neutral</p>
<p>swoon of the background. Or again, it might be a stern El Greco horizon,</p>
<p>pregnant with inky rain, and a passing glimpse of some mummy-necked farmer,</p>
<p>and all around alternating strips of quick-silverish water and harsh green</p>
<p>corn, the whole arrangement opening like a fan, somewhere in Kansas.</p>
<p> Now and then, in the vastness of those plains, huge trees would advance</p>
<p>toward us to cluster self-consciously by the roadside and provide a bit of</p>
<p>humanitarian shade above a picnic table, with sun flecks, flattened paper</p>
<p>cups, samaras and discarded ice-cream sticks littering the brown ground. A</p>
<p>great user of roadside facilities, my unfastidious Lo would be charmed by</p>
<p>toilet signs&#x2013;Guys-Gals, John-Jane, Jack-Jill and even Buck&#x2019;s-Doe&#x2019;s; while</p>
<p>lost in an artist&#x2019;s dream, I would stare at the honest brightness of the</p>
<p>gasoline paraphernalia against the splendid green of oaks, or at a distant</p>
<p>hill scrambling out&#x2013;scarred but still untamed&#x2013;from the wilderness of</p>
<p>agriculture that was trying to swallow it.</p>
<p> At night, tall trucks studded with colored lights, like dreadful giant</p>
<p>Christmas trees, loomed in the darkness and thundered by the belated little</p>
<p>sedan. And again next day a thinly populated sky, losing its blue to the</p>
<p>heat, would melt overhead, and Lo would clamor for a drink, and her cheeks</p>
<p>would hollow vigorously over the straw, and the car inside would be a</p>
<p>furnace when we got in again, and the road shimmered ahead, with a remote</p>
<p>car changing its shape mirage-like in the surface glare, and seeming to hang</p>
<p>for a moment, old-fashionedly square and high, in the hot haze. And as we</p>
<p>pushed westward, patches of what the garage-man called &#x201C;sage brush&#x201D;</p>
<p>appeared, and then the mysterious outlines of table-like hills, and then red</p>
<p>bluffs ink-blotted with junipers, and then a mountain range, dun grading</p>
<p>into blue, and blue into dream, and the desert would meet us with a steady</p>
<p>gale, dust, gray thorn bushes, and hideous bits of tissue paper mimicking</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (108 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>pale flowers among the prickles of wind-tortured withered stalks all along</p>
<p>the highway; in the middle of which there sometimes stood simple cows,</p>
<p>immobilized in a position (tail left, white eyelashes right) cutting across</p>
<p>all human rules of traffic.</p>
<p> My lawyer has suggested I give a clear, frank account of the itinerary</p>
<p>we followed, and I suppose I have reached here a point where I cannot avoid</p>
<p>that chore. Roughly, during that mad year (August 1947 to August 1948), our</p>
<p>route began with a series of wiggles and whorls in New England, then</p>
<p>meandered south, up and down, east and west; dipped deep into ce qu&#x2019;on</p>
<p>appelle Dixieland, avoided Florida because the Farlows were there,</p>
<p>veered west, zigzagged through corn belts and cotton belts (this is not</p>
<p>too clear I am afraid, Clarence, but I did not keep any notes, and</p>
<p>have at my disposal only an atrociously crippled tour book in three volumes,</p>
<p>almost a symbol of my torn and tattered past, in which to check these</p>
<p>recollections); crossed and recrossed the Rockies, straggled through</p>
<p>southern deserts where we wintered; reached the Pacific, turned north</p>
<p>through the pale lilac fluff of flowering shrubs along forest roads; almost</p>
<p>reached the Canadian border; and proceeded east, across good lands and bad</p>
<p>lands, back to agriculture on a grand scale, avoiding, despite little Lo&#x2019;s</p>
<p>strident remonstrations, little Lo&#x2019;s birthplace, in a corn, coal and hog</p>
<p>producing area; and finally returned to the fold of the East, petering out</p>
<p>in the college town of Beardsley.</p>
<p> 2</p>
<p> Now, in perusing what follows, the reader should bear in mind not only</p>
<p>the general circuit as adumbrated above, with its many sidetrips and tourist</p>
<p>traps, secondary circles and skittish deviations, but also the fact that far</p>
<p>from being an indolent partie de plaisir, our tour was a hard,</p>
<p>twisted, teleological growth, whose sole raison d&#x2019;&#xE9;tre (these French</p>
<p>clich&#xE8;s are symptomatic) was to keep my companion in passable humor from</p>
<p>kiss to kiss.</p>
<p> Thumbing through that battered tour book, I dimly evoke that Magnolia</p>
<p>Garden in a southern state which cost me four bucks and which, according to</p>
<p>the ad in the book, you must visit for three reasons: because John</p>
<p>Galsworthy (a stone-dead writer of sorts) acclaimed it as the world&#x2019;s</p>
<p>fairest garden; because in 1900 Baedeker&#x2019;s Guide had marked it with a star;</p>
<p>and finally, because . . . O, Reader, My Reader, guess! . . . because</p>
<p>children (and by Jingo was not my Lolita a child!) will &#x201C;walk starry-eyed</p>
<p>and reverently through this foretaste of Heaven, drinking in beauty that can</p>
<p>influence a life.&#x201D; &#x201C;Not mine,&#x201D; said grim Lo, and settled down on a bench</p>
<p>with the fillings of two Sunday papers in her lovely lap.</p>

<p> We passed and re-passed through the whole gamut of American roadside</p>
<p>restaurants, from the lowly Eat with its deer head (dark trace of long tear</p>
<p>at inner canthus), &#x201C;humorous&#x201D; picture post cards of the posterior &#x201C;Kurort&#x201D;</p>
<p>type, impaled guest checks, life savers, sunglasses, adman visions of</p>
<p>celestial sundaes, one half of a chocolate cake under glass, and several</p>
<p>horribly experienced flies zigzagging over the sticky sugar-pour on the</p>
<p>ignoble counter; and all the way to the expensive place with the subdued</p>
<p>lights, preposterously poor table linen, inept waiters (ex-convicts or</p>
<p>college boys), the roan back of a screen actress, the sable eyebrows of her</p>
<p>male of the moment, and an orchestra of zoot-suiters with trumpets.</p>
<p> We inspected the world&#x2019;s largest stalagmite in a cave where three</p>
<p>southeastern states have a family reunion; admission by age; adults one</p>
<p>dollar, pubescents sixty cents. A granite obelisk commemorating the Battle</p>
<p>of Blue Licks, with old bones and Indian pottery in the museum nearby, Lo a</p>
<p>dime, very reasonable. The present log cabin boldly simulating the past log</p>
<p>cabin where Lincoln was born. A boulder, with a plaque, in memory of the</p>
<p>author of &#x201C;Trees&#x201D; (by now we are in Poplar Cove, N.C., reached by what my</p>
<p>kind, tolerant, usually so restrained tour book angrily calls &#x201C;a very narrow</p>
<p>road, poorly maintained,&#x201D; to which, though no Kilmerite, I subscribe). From</p>
<p>a hired motor-boat operated by an elderly, but still repulsively handsome</p>
<p>White Russian, a baron they said (Lo&#x2019;s palms were damp, the little fool),</p>
<p>who had known in California good old Maximovich and Valeria, we could</p>
<p>distinguish the inaccessible &#x201C;millionaires&#x2019; colony&#x201D; on an island, somewhere</p>
<p>off the Georgia coast. We inspected further: a collection of European hotel</p>
<p>picture post cards in a museum devoted to hobbies at a Mississippi resort,</p>
<p>where with a hot wave of pride I discovered a colored photo of my father&#x2019;s</p>
<p>Mirana, its striped awnings, its flag flying above the retouched palm trees.</p>
<p>&#x201C;So what?&#x201D; said Lo, squinting at the bronzed owner of an expensive car who</p>
<p>had followed us into the Hobby House. Relics of the cotton era. A forest in</p>
<p>Arkansas and, on her brown shoulder, a raised purple-pink swelling (the work</p>
<p>of some gnat) which I eased of its beautiful transparent poison between my</p>
<p>long thumbnails and then sucked till I was gorged on her spicy blood.</p>
<p>Bourbon Street (in a town named New Orleans) whose sidewalks, said the tour</p>
<p>book, &#x201C;may [I liked the &#x201C;may&#x201D;] feature entertainment by pickaninnies who</p>
<p>will {I liked the &#x201C;will&#x201D; even better] tap-dance for pennies&#x201D; (what fun),</p>
<p>while &#x201C;its numerous small and intimate night clubs are thronged with</p>
<p>visitors&#x201D; (naughty). Collections of frontier lore. Ante-bellum homes with</p>
<p>iron-trellis balconies and hand-worked stairs, the kind down which movie</p>
<p>ladies with sun-kissed shoulders run in rich Technicolor, holding up the</p>
<p>fronts of their flounced skirts with both little hands in that special way,</p>
<p>and the devoted Negress shaking her head on the upper landing. The Menninger</p>
<p>Foundation, a psychiatric clinic, just for the heck of it. A patch of</p>
<p>beautifully eroded clay; and yucca blossoms, so pure, so waxy, but lousy</p>

<p>south-eastern ranges, altitudinal failures as alps go; heart and</p>
<p>sky-piercing snow-veined gray colossi of stone, relentless peaks appearing</p>
<p>from nowhere at a turn of the highway; timbered enormities, with a system of</p>

<p>oatmeal hills, flecked with green round oaks; a last rufous mountain with a</p>
<p>rich rug of lucerne at its foot.</p>
<p> Moreover, we inspected: Little Iceberg Lake, somewhere in Colorado, and</p>
<p>the snow banks, and the cushionets of tiny alpine flowers, and more snow;</p>
<p>down which Lo in red-peaked cap tried to slide, and squealed, and was</p>
<p>snowballed by some youngsters, and retaliated in kind comme on dit.</p>
<p>Skeletons of burned aspens, patches of spired blue flowers. The various</p>

<p>Crystal Chamber in the longest cave in the world, children under 12 free, Lo</p>
<p>a young captive. A collection of a local lady&#x2019;s homemade sculptures, closed</p>

<p>hundreds of gray hummingbirds in the dusk, probing the throats of dim</p>

<p>The mummy of a child (Florentine Bea&#x2019;s Indian contemporary). Our twentieth</p>

<p>groin. Always the same three old men, in hats and suspenders, idling away</p>
<p>the summer afternoon under the trees near the public fountain. A hazy blue</p>
<p>view beyond railings on a mountain pass, and the backs of a family enjoying</p>

<p>foothills, almonds in bloom. Reno, a dreary town in Nevada, with a nightlife</p>
<p>said to be &#x201C;cosmopolitan and mature.&#x201D; A winery in California, with a church</p>
<p>built in the shape of a wine barrel. Death Valley. Scotty&#x2019;s Castle. Works of</p>
<p>Art collected by one Rogers over a period of years. The ugly villas of</p>
<p>handsome actresses. R. L. Stevenson&#x2019;s footprint on an extinct volcano.</p>

<p>chateau built by a French marquess in N.D. The Corn Palace in S.D.; and the</p>
<p>huge heads of presidents carved in towering granite. The Bearded Woman read</p>
<p>our jingle and now she is no longer single. A zoo in Indiana where a large</p>
<p>troop of monkeys lived on concrete replica of Christopher Columbus&#x2019;</p>
<p>flagship. Billions of dead, or halfdead, fish-smelling May flies in every</p>
<p>window of every eating place all along a dreary sandy shore. Fat gulls on</p>
<p>big stones as seen from the ferry City of Cheboygan, whose brown</p>
<p>woolly smoke arched and dipped over the green shadow it cast on the</p>
<p>aquamarine lake. A motel whose ventilator pipe passed under the city sewer.</p>
<p>Lincoln&#x2019;s home, largely spurious, with parlor books and period furniture</p>
<p>that most visitors reverently accepted as personal belongings.</p>
<p> We had rows, minor and major. The biggest ones we had took place: at</p>
<p>Lacework Cabins, Virginia; on Park Avenue, Little Rock, near a school; on</p>
<p>Milner Pass, 10,759 feet high, in Colorado; at the corner of Seventh Street</p>
<p>and Central Avenue in Phoenix, Arizona; on Third Street, Los Angeles,</p>
<p>because the tickets to some studio or other were sold out; at a motel called</p>
<p>Poplar Shade in Utah, where six pubescent trees were scarcely taller than my</p>
<p>Lolita, and where she asked, &#xFE; propos de rien, how long did I think</p>
<p>we were going to live in stuffy cabins, doing filthy things together and</p>
<p>never behaving like ordinary people? On N. Broadway, Burns, Oregon, corner</p>
<p>of W. Washington, facing Safeway, a grocery. In some little town in the Sun</p>
<p>Valley of Idaho, before a brick hotel, pale and flushed bricks nicely mixed,</p>
<p>with, opposite, a poplar playing its liquid shadows all over the local Honor</p>
<p>Roll. In a sage brush wilderness, between Pinedale and Farson. Somewhere in</p>
<p>Nebraska, on Main Street, near the First National Bank, established 1889,</p>
<p>with a view of a railway crossing in the vista of the street, and beyond</p>
<p>that the white organ pipes of a multiple silo. And on McEwen St., corner of</p>
<p>Wheaton Ave., in a Michigan town bearing his first name.</p>
<p> We came to know the curious roadside species, Hitchhiking Man, Homo</p>
<p>pollex of science, with all its many sub-species and forms; the modest</p>
<p>soldier, spic and span, quietly waiting, quietly conscious of khaki&#x2019;s</p>
<p>viatric appeal; the schoolboy wishing to go two blocks; the killer wishing</p>

<p>to go two thousand miles; the mysterious, nervous, elderly gent, with</p>
<p>brand-new suitcase and clipped mustache; a trio of optimistic Mexicans; the</p>
<p>college student displaying the grime of vacational outdoor work as proudly</p>
<p>as the name of the famous college arching across the front of his</p>
<p>sweatshirt; the desperate lady whose battery has just died on her; the</p>
<p>clean-cut, glossy-haired, shifty-eyed, white-faced young beasts in loud</p>
<p>shirts and coats, vigorously, almost priapically thrusting out tense thumbs</p>
<p>to tempt lone women or sadsack salesmen with fancy cravings.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s take him,&#x201D; Lo would often plead, rubbing her knees together in a</p>
<p>way she had, as some particularly disgusting pollex, some man of my</p>
<p>age and shoulder breadth, with the face &#xFE; claques of unemployed</p>
<p>actor, walked backwards, practically in the path of our car.</p>
<p> Oh, I had to keep a very sharp eye on Lo, little limp Lo! Owing perhaps</p>
<p>to constant amorous exercise, she radiated, despite her very childish</p>
<p>appearance, some special languorous glow which threw garage fellows, hotel</p>
<p>pages, vacationists, goons in luxurious cars, maroon morons near blued</p>
<p>pools, into fits of concupiscence which might have tickled my pride, had it</p>
<p>not incensed my jealousy. For little Lo was aware of that glow of hers, and</p>
<p>I would often catch her coulant un regard in the direction of some</p>
<p>amiable male, some grease monkey, with a sinewy golden-brown forearm and</p>
<p>watch-braceleted wrist, and hardly had I turned my back to go and buy this</p>
<p>very Lo a lollipop, than I would hear her and the fair mechanic burst into a</p>
<p>perfect love song of wisecracks.</p>
<p> When, during our longer stops, I would relax after a particularly</p>
<p>violent morning in bed, and out of the goodness of my lulled heart allow</p>
<p>her&#x2013;indulgent Hum!&#x2013;to visit the rose garden or children&#x2019;s library across</p>
<p>the street with a motor court neighbor&#x2019;s plain little Mary and Mary&#x2019;s</p>
<p>eight-year-old brother, Lo would come back an hour late, with barefoot Mary</p>
<p>trailing far behind, and the little boy metamorphosed into two gangling,</p>
<p>golden-haired high school uglies, all muscles and gonorrhea. The reader may</p>
<p>well imagine what I answered my pet when&#x2013;rather uncertainly, I admit&#x2013;she</p>
<p>would ask me if she could go with Carl and Al here to the roller-skating</p>
<p>rink.</p>
<p> I remember the first time, a dusty windy afternoon, I did let her go to</p>
<p>one such rink. Cruelly she said it would be no fun if I accompanied her,</p>
<p>since that time of day was reserved for teenagers. We wrangled out a</p>
<p>compromise: I remained in the car, among other (empty) cars with their noses</p>
<p>to the canvas-topped open-air rink, where some fifty young people, many in</p>
<p>pairs, were endlessly rolling round and round to mechanical music, and the</p>
<p>wind silvered the trees. Dolly wore blue jeans and white high shoes, as most</p>
<p>of the other girls did. I kept counting the revolutions of the rolling</p>
<p>crowd&#x2013;and suddenly she was missing. When she rolled past again, she was</p>
<p>together with three hoodlums whom I had heard analyze a moment before the</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (113 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>girl skaters from the outside&#x2013;and jeer at a lovely leggy young thing who</p>
<p>had arrived clad in red shorts instead of those jeans and slacks.</p>
<p> At inspection stations on highways entering Arizona or California, a</p>
<p>policeman&#x2019;s cousin would peer with such intensity at us that my poor heart</p>
<p>wobbled. &#x201C;Any honey?&#x201D; he would inquire, and every time my sweet fool</p>
<p>giggled. I still have, vibrating all along my optic nerve, visions of Lo on</p>
<p>horseback, a link in the chain of a guided trip along a bridle trail: Lo</p>
<p>bobbing at a walking pace, with an old woman rider in front and a lecherous</p>
<p>red-necked dude-rancher behind; and I behind him, hating his fat</p>
<p>flowery-shirted back even more fervently than a motorist does a slow truck</p>
<p>on a mountain road. Or else, at a ski lodge, I would see her floating away</p>
<p>from me, celestial and solitary, in an ethereal chairlift, up and up, to a</p>
<p>glittering summit where laughing athletes stripped to the waist were waiting</p>
<p>for her, for her.</p>
<p> In whatever town we stopped I would inquire, in my polite European way,</p>
<p>anent the whereabouts of natatoriums, museums, local schools, the number of</p>
<p>children in the nearest school and so forth; and at school bus time, smiling</p>
<p>and twitching a little (I discovered this tic nerveux because cruel</p>
<p>Lo was the first to mimic it), I would park at a strategic point, with my</p>
<p>vagrant schoolgirl beside me in the car, to watch the children leave</p>
<p>school&#x2013;always a pretty sight. This sort of thing soon began to bore my so</p>
<p>easily bored Lolita, and, having a childish lack of sympathy for other</p>
<p>people&#x2019;s whims, she would insult me and my desire to have her caress me</p>
<p>while blue-eyed little brunettes in blue shorts, copperheads in green</p>
<p>boleros, and blurred boyish blondes in faded slacks passed by in the sun.</p>
<p> As a sort of compromise, I freely advocated whenever and wherever</p>
<p>possible the use of swimming pools with other girl-children. She adored</p>
<p>brilliant water and was a remarkably smart diver. Comfortably robed, I would</p>
<p>settle down in the rich post-meridian shade after my own demure dip, and</p>
<p>there I would sit, with a dummy book or a bag of bonbons, or both, or</p>
<p>nothing but my tingling glands, and watch her gambol, rubber-capped,</p>
<p>bepearled, smoothly tanned, as glad as an ad, in her trim-fitted satin pants</p>
<p>and shirred bra. Pubescent sweetheart! How smugly would I marvel that she</p>
<p>was mine, mine, mine, and revise the recent matitudinal swoon to the moan of</p>
<p>the mourning doves, and devise the late afternoon one, and slitting my</p>
<p>sun-speared eyes, compare Lolita to whatever other nymphets parsimonious</p>
<p>chance collected around her for my anthological delectation and judgment;</p>
<p>and today, putting my hand on my ailing heart, I really do not think that</p>
<p>any of them ever surpassed her in desirability, or if they did, it was so</p>
<p>two or three times at the most, in a certain light, with certain perfumes</p>
<p>blended in the air&#x2013;once in the hopeless case of a pale Spanish child, the</p>
<p>daughter of a heavy-jawed nobleman, and another time&#x2013;mais je</p>
<p>divague.</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (114 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p> Naturally, I had to be always wary, fully realizing, in my lucid</p>
<p>jealousy, the danger of those dazzling romps. I had only to turn away for a</p>
<p>moment&#x2013;to walk, say, a few steps in order to see if our cabin was at last</p>
<p>ready after the morning change of linen&#x2013;and Lo and Behold, upon returning,</p>
<p>I would find the former, les yeux perdus, dipping and kicking her</p>
<p>long-toed feet in the water on the stone edge of which she lolled, while, on</p>
<p>either side of her, there crouched a brun adolescent whom her russet</p>
<p>beauty and the quicksilver in the baby folds of her stomach were sure to</p>
<p>cause to se tordre&#x2013;oh Baudelaire!&#x2013;in recurrent dreams for months to</p>
<p>come.</p>
<p> I tried to teach her to play tennis so we might have more amusements in</p>
<p>common; but although I had been a good player in my prime, I proved to be</p>
<p>hopeless as a teacher; and so, in California, I got her to take a number of</p>
<p>very expensive lessons with a famous coach, a husky, wrinkled old-timer,</p>
<p>with a harem of ball boys; he looked an awful wreck off the court, but now</p>
<p>and then, when, in the course of a lesson, to keep up the exchange, he would</p>
<p>put out as it were an exquisite spring blossom of a stroke and twang the</p>
<p>ball back to his pupil, that divine delicacy of absolute power made me</p>
<p>recall that, thirty years before, I had seen him in Cannes demolish</p>
<p>the great Gobbert! Until she began taking those lessons, I thought she would</p>
<p>never learn the game. On this or that hotel court I would drill Lo, and try</p>
<p>to relive the days when in a hot gale, a daze of dust, and queer lassitude,</p>
<p>I fed ball after ball to gay, innocent, elegant Annabel (gleam of bracelet,</p>
<p>pleated white skirt, black velvet hair band). With every word of persistent</p>
<p>advice I would only augment Lo&#x2019;s sullen fury. To our games, oddly enough,</p>
<p>she preferred&#x2013;at least, before we reached California&#x2013;formless pat ball</p>
<p>approximations&#x2013;more ball hunting than actual play&#x2013;with a wispy, weak,</p>
<p>wonderfully pretty in an ange gauche way coeval. A helpful spectator,</p>
<p>I would go up to that other child, and inhale her faint musky fragrance as I</p>
<p>touched her forearm and held her knobby wrist, and push this way or that her</p>
<p>cool thigh to show her the back-hand stance. In the meantime, Lo, bending</p>
<p>forward, would let her sunny-brown curls hang forward as she stuck her</p>
<p>racket, like a cripple&#x2019;s stick, into the ground and emitted a tremendous ugh</p>
<p>of disgust at my intrusion. I would leave them to their game and look on,</p>
<p>comparing their bodies in motion, a silk scarf round my throat; this was in</p>
<p>south Arizona, I think&#x2013;and the days had a lazy lining warmth, and awkward</p>
<p>Lo would slash at the ball and miss it, and curse, and send a simulacrum of</p>
<p>a serve into the net, and show the wet glistening young down of her armpit</p>
<p>as she brandished her racket in despair, and her even more insipid partner</p>
<p>would dutifully rush out after every ball, and retrieve none; but both were</p>
<p>enjoying themselves beautifully, and in clear ringing tones kept the exact</p>
<p>score of their ineptitudes all the time.</p>
<p> One day, I remember, I offered to bring them cold drinks from the</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (115 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>hotel, and went up the gravel path, and came back with two tall glasses of</p>
<p>pineapple juice, soda and ice; and then a sudden void within my chest made</p>
<p>me stop as I saw that the tennis court was deserted. I stooped to set down</p>
<p>the glasses on a bench and for some reason, with a kind of icy vividness,</p>
<p>saw Charlotte&#x2019;s face in death, and I glanced around, and noticed Lo in white</p>
<p>shorts receding through the speckled shadow of a garden path in the company</p>
<p>of a tall man who carried two tennis rackets. I sprang after them, but as I</p>
<p>was crashing through the shrubbery, I saw, in an alternate vision, as if</p>
<p>life&#x2019;s course constantly branched, Lo, in slacks, and her companion, in</p>
<p>shorts, trudging up and down a small weedy area, and beating bushes with</p>
<p>their rackets in listless search for their last lost ball.</p>
<p> I itemize these sunny nothings mainly to prove to my judges that I did</p>
<p>everything in my power to give my Lolita a really good time. How charming it</p>
<p>was to see her, a child herself, showing another child some of her few</p>
<p>accomplishments, such as for example a special way of jumping rope. With her</p>
<p>right hand holding her left arm behind her untanned back, the lesser</p>
<p>nymphet, a diaphanous darling, would be all eyes, as the pavonine sun was</p>
<p>all eyes on the gravel under the flowering trees, while in the midst of that</p>
<p>oculate paradise, my freckled and raffish lass skipped, repeating the</p>
<p>movements of so many others I had gloated over on the sun-shot, watered,</p>
<p>damp-smelling sidewalks and ramparts of ancient Europe. Presently, she would</p>
<p>hand the rope back to her little Spanish friend, and watch in her turn the</p>
<p>repeated lesson, and brush away the hair from her brow, and fold her arms,</p>
<p>and step on one toe with the other, or drop her hands loosely upon her still</p>
<p>unflared hips, and I would satisfy myself that the damned staff had at last</p>
<p>finished cleaning up our cottage; whereupon, flashing a smile to the shy,</p>
<p>dark-haired page girl of my princess and thrusting my fatherly fingers deep</p>
<p>into Lo&#x2019;s hair from behind, and then gently but firmly clasping them around</p>
<p>the nape of her neck, I would lead my reluctant pet to our small home for a</p>
<p>quick connection before dinner.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Whose cat has scratched poor you?&#x201D; A full-blown fleshy handsome woman</p>
<p>of the repulsive type to which I was particularly attractive might ask me at</p>
<p>the &#x201C;lodge,&#x201D; during a table d&#x2019;hote dinner followed by dancing promised to</p>
<p>Lo. This was one of the reasons why I tried to keep as far away from people</p>
<p>as possible, while Lo, on the other hand, would do her utmost to draw as</p>
<p>many potential witnesses into her orbit as she could.</p>
<p> She would be, figuratively speaking wagging her tiny tail, her whole</p>
<p>behind in fact as little bitches do&#x2013;while some grinning stranger accosted</p>
<p>us and began a bright conversation with a comparative study of license</p>
<p>plates. &#x201C;Long way from home!&#x201D; Inquisitive parents, in order to pump Lo about</p>
<p>me, would suggest her going to a movie with their children. We had some</p>
<p>close shaves. The waterfall nuisance pursued me of course in all our</p>
<p>caravansaries. But I never realized how wafery their wall substance was</p>

<p>until one evening, after I had loved too loudly, a neighbor&#x2019;s masculine</p>
<p>cough filled the pause as clearly as mine would have done; and next morning</p>
<p>as I was having breakfast at the milk bar (Lo was a late sleeper, and I</p>
<p>liked to bring her a pot of hot coffee in bed), my neighbor of the eve, an</p>
<p>elderly fool wearing plain glasses on his long virtuous nose and a</p>
<p>convention badge on his lapel, somehow managed to rig up a conversation with</p>
<p>me, in the course of which he inquired, if my missus was like his missus a</p>
<p>rather reluctant get-upper when not on the farm; and had not the hideous</p>
<p>danger I was skirting almost suffocated me, I might have enjoyed the odd</p>
<p>look of surprise on his thin-lipped weather-beaten face when I dryly</p>
<p>answered, as I slithered off my stool, that I was thank God a widower.</p>
<p> How sweet it was to bring that coffee to her, and then deny it until</p>
<p>she had done her morning duty. And I was such a thoughtful friend, such a</p>
<p>passionate father, such a good pediatrician, attending to all the wants of</p>
<p>my little auburn brunette&#x2019;s body! My only grudge against nature was that I</p>
<p>could not turn my Lolita inside out and apply voracious lips to her young</p>
<p>matrix, her unknown heart, her nacreous liver, the sea-grapes of her lungs,</p>
<p>her comely twin kidneys. On especially tropical afternoons, in the sticky</p>
<p>closeness of the siesta, I liked the cool feel of armchair leather against</p>
<p>my massive nakedness as I held her in my lap. There she would be, a typical</p>
<p>kid picking her nose while engrossed in the lighter sections of a newspaper,</p>
<p>as indifferent to my ecstasy as if it were something she had sat upon, a</p>
<p>shoe, a doll, the handle of a tennis racket, and was too indolent to remove.</p>
<p>Her eyes would follow the adventures of her favorite strip characters: there</p>
<p>was one well-drawn sloppy bobby-soxer, with high cheekbones and angular</p>
<p>gestures, that I was not above enjoying myself; she studied the photographic</p>
<p>results of head-on collisions; she never doubted the reality of place, time,</p>
<p>and circumstance alleged to match the publicity pictures of naked-thighed</p>
<p>beauties; and she was curiously fascinated by the photographs of local</p>
<p>brides, some in full wedding apparel, holding bouquets and wearing glasses.</p>
<p> A fly would settle and walk in the vicinity of her navel or explore her</p>
<p>tender pale areolas. She tried to catch it in her fist (Charlotte&#x2019;s method)</p>
<p>and then would turn to the column Let&#x2019;s Explore Your Mind.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s explore your mind. Would sex crimes be reduced if children</p>
<p>obeyed a few don&#x2019;ts? Don&#x2019;t play around public toilets. Don&#x2019;t take candy or</p>
<p>rides from strangers. If picked up, mark down the license of the car.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;. . . and the brand of the candy,&#x201D; I volunteered.</p>
<p> She went on, her cheek (recedent) against mine (pursuant); and this was</p>
<p>a good day, mark, O reader!</p>

<p>number somehow on the roadside.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;With your little claws, Lolita.&#x201D;</p>
<p> She had entered my world, umber and black Humberland, with rash</p>
<p>curiosity; she surveyed it with a shrug of amused distaste; and it seemed to</p>
<p>me now that she was ready to turn away from it with something akin to plain</p>
<p>repulsion. Never did she vibrate under my touch, and a strident &#x201C;what d&#x2019;you</p>
<p>think you are doing?&#x201D; was all I got for my pains. To the wonderland I had to</p>
<p>offer, my fool preferred the corniest movies, the most cloying fudge. To</p>
<p>think that between a Hamburger and a Humburger, she would&#x2013;invariably, with</p>
<p>icy precision&#x2013;plump for the former. There is nothing more atrociously cruel</p>
<p>than an adored child. Did I mention the name of that milk bar I visited a</p>
<p>moment ago? It was, of all things, The Frigid Queen. Smiling a little sadly,</p>
<p>I dubbed her My Frigid Princess. She did not see the wistful joke.</p>
<p> Oh, do not scowl at me, reader, I do not intend to convey the impressin</p>
<p>that I did not manage to be happy. Readeer must understand that in the</p>
<p>possession and thralldom of a nymphet the enchanted traveler stands, as it</p>
<p>were, beyond happiness. For there is no other bliss on earth</p>
<p>comparable to that of fondling a nymphet. It is hors concours, that</p>
<p>bliss, it belongs to another class, another plane of sensitivity. Despite</p>
<p>our tiffs, despite her nastiness, despite all the fuss and faces she made,</p>
<p>and the vulgarity, and the danger, and the horrible hopelessness of it all,</p>
<p>I still dwelled deep in my elected paradise&#x2013;a paradise whose skies were the</p>
<p>color of hell-flames&#x2013;but still a paradise.</p>
<p> The able psychiatrist who studies my case&#x2013;and whom by now Dr. Humbert</p>
<p>has plunged, I trust, into a state of leporine fascination&#x2013;is no doubt</p>
<p>anxious to have me take Lolita to the seaside and have me find there, at</p>
<p>last, the &#x201C;gratification&#x201D; of a lifetime urge, and release from the</p>
<p>&#x201C;subconscious&#x201D; obsession of an incomplete childhood romance with the initial</p>
<p>little Miss Lee.</p>
<p> Well, comrade, let me tell you that I did look for a beach,</p>
<p>though I also have to confess that by the time we reached its mirage of gray</p>
<p>water, so many delights had already been granted me by my traveling</p>
<p>companion that the search for a Kingdom by the Sea, a Sublimated Riviera, or</p>
<p>whatnot, far from being the impulse of the subconscious, had become the</p>
<p>rational pursuit of a purely theoretical thrill. The angels knew it, and</p>
<p>arranged things accordingly. A visit to a plausible cove on the Atlantic</p>
<p>side was completely messed up by foul weather. A thick damp sky, muddy</p>
<p>waves, a sense of boundless but somehow matter-of-fact mist&#x2013;what could be</p>
<p>further removed from the crisp charm, the sapphire occasion and rosy</p>
<p>contingency of my Riviera romance? A couple of semitropical beaches on the</p>
<p>Gulf, though bright enough, were starred and spattered by venomous beasties</p>
<p>and swept by hurricane winds. Finally, on a Californian beach, facing the</p>
<p>phantom of the Pacific, I hit upon some rather perverse privacy in a kind of</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (118 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>cave whence you could hear the shrikes of a lot of girl scouts taking their</p>
<p>first surf bath on a separate part of the beach, behind rotting trees; but</p>
<p>the fog was like a wet blanket, and the sand was gritty and clammy, and Lo</p>
<p>was all gooseflesh and grit, and for the first time in my life I had as</p>
<p>little desire for her as for a manatee. Perhaps, my learned readers may perk</p>
<p>up if I tell them that even had we discovered a piece of sympathetic seaside</p>
<p>somewhere, it would have come too late, since my real liberation had</p>
<p>occurred much earlier: at the moment, in point of fact, when Annabel Haze,</p>
<p>alias Dolores Lee, alias Loleeta, had appeared tome, golden and brown,</p>
<p>kneeling, looking up, on that shoddy veranda, in a kind of fictitious,</p>
<p>dishonest, but eminently satisfactory seaside arrangement (although there</p>
<p>was nothing but a second-rate lake in the neighborhood.).</p>
<p> So much for those special sensations, influence, if not actually</p>
<p>brought about, by the tenets of modern psychiatry. Consequently, I turned</p>
<p>away&#x2013;I headed my Lolita away&#x2013;from beaches which were either too bleak when</p>
<p>lone, or too populous when ablaze. However, in recollection, I suppose, of</p>
<p>my hopeless hauntings of public parks in Europe, I was still keenly</p>
<p>interested in outdoor activities and desirous of finding suitable</p>
<p>playgrounds in the open where I had suffered such shameful privations. Here,</p>
<p>too, I was to be thwarted. The disappointment I must now register (as I</p>
<p>gently grade my story into an expression of the continuous risk and dread</p>
<p>that ran through my bliss) should in no wise reflect on the lyrical, epic,</p>
<p>tragic but never Arcadian American wilds. They are beautiful,</p>
<p>heart-rendingly beautiful, those wilds, with a quality of wide-eyed, unsung,</p>
<p>innocent surrender that my lacquered, toy-bright Swiss villages and</p>
<p>exhaustively lauded Alps no longer possess. Innumerable lovers have clipped</p>
<p>and kissed on the trim turf of old-would mountainsides, on the innerspring</p>
<p>moss, by a handy, hygienic rill, on rustic benches under the initialed oaks,</p>
<p>and in so many cabanes in so many beech forests. But in the Wilds of</p>
<p>America the open-air lover will not find it easy to indulge in the most</p>
<p>ancient of all crimes and pastimes. Poisonous plants burn his sweetheart&#x2019;s</p>
<p>buttocks, nameless insects sting his; sharp items of the forest floor prick</p>
<p>his knees, insects hers; and all around there abides a sustained rustle of</p>
<p>potential snakes&#x2013;que dis-je, of semi-extinct dragons!&#x2013;while the</p>
<p>crablike seeds of ferocious flowers cling, in a hideous green crust, to</p>
<p>gartered black sock and sloppy white sock alike.</p>
<p> I am exaggerating a little. One summer noon, just below timberline,</p>
<p>where heavenly-hued blossoms that I would fain call larkspur crowded all</p>
<p>along a purly moutain brook, we did find, Lolita and I, a secluded romantic</p>
<p>spot, a hundred feet or so above the pass where we had left our car. The</p>
<p>slope seemed untrodden. A last panting pine was taking a well-earned</p>
<p>breather on the rock it had reached. A marmot whistled at us and withdrew.</p>
<p>Beneath the lap-robe I had spread fo Lo, dryflowers crepitated softly.</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (119 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>Venus came and went. The jagged cliff crowning the upper talus and a tangle</p>
<p>of shrugs growing below us seemed to offer us protection from sun and man</p>
<p>alike. Alas, I had not reckoned with a faint side trail that curled up in</p>
<p>cagey fashion among the shrubs and rocks a few feet from us.</p>
<p> It was then that we came close to detection than ever before, and no</p>
<p>wonder the experience curbed forever my yearning for rural amours.</p>
<p> I remember the operation was over, all over, and she was weeping in my</p>
<p>arms;&#x2013;a salutory storm of sobs after one of the fits of moodiness that had</p>
<p>become so frequent with her in the course of that otherwise admirable year!</p>
<p>I had just retracted some silly promise she had forced me to make in a</p>
<p>moment of blind impatient passion, and thee she was sprawling and sobbing,</p>
<p>and pinching my caressing hand, and I was laughing happily, and the</p>
<p>atrocious, unbelievable, unbearable, and, I suspect, eternal horror that I</p>
<p>know now was still but a dot of blackness in the blue of my bliss;</p>
<p>and so we lay, when with one of those jolts that have ended by knocking my</p>
<p>poor heart out of its groove, I met the unblinking dark eyes of two strange</p>
<p>and beautiful children, faunlet and nymphet, whom their identical flat dark</p>
<p>hair and bloodless cheeks proclaimed siblings if not twins. They stood</p>
<p>crouching and gaping at us, both in blue playsuits, blending with the</p>
<p>mountain blossoms. I plucked at the lap-robe for desperate concealment&#x2013;and</p>
<p>within the same instant, something that looked like a polka-dotted pushball</p>
<p>among the undergrowth a few paces away, went into a turning motion which was</p>
<p>transformed into the gradually rising figure of a stout lady with a</p>
<p>raven-black bob, who automatically added a wild lily to her bouquet, while</p>
<p>staring over her shoulder at us from behind her lovely carved bluestone</p>
<p>children.</p>
<p> Now that I have an altogether different mess on my conscience, I know</p>
<p>that I am a courageous man, but in those days I was not aware of it, and I</p>
<p>remember being surprised by my own coolness. With the quiet murmured order</p>
<p>one gives a sweat-stained distracted cringing trained animal even in the</p>
<p>worst of plights (what mad hope or hate makes the young beast&#x2019;s flanks</p>
<p>pulsate, what black stars pierce the heart of the tamer!), I made Lo get up,</p>
<p>and we decorously walked, and then indecorously scuttled down to the car.</p>
<p>Behind it a nifty station wagon was parked, and a handsome Assyrian with a</p>
<p>little blue-black beard, un monsieur tr&#xF5;s bien, in silk shirt and</p>
<p>magenta slacks, presumably the corpulent botanist&#x2019;s husband, was gravely</p>
<p>taking the picture of a signboard giving the altitude of the pass. It was</p>
<p>well over 10,000 feet and I was quite out of breath; and with a scrunch and</p>
<p>a skid we drove off, Lo still struggling with her clothes and swearing at me</p>
<p>in language that I never dreamed little girls could know, let alone use.</p>
<p> There were other unpleasant incidents. There was the movie theatre</p>
<p>once, for example. Lo at the time still had for the cinema a veritable</p>
<p>passion (it was to decline into tepid condescension during her second high</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (120 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>school year). We took in, voluptuously and indiscriminately, oh, I don&#x2019;t</p>
<p>know, one hundred and fifty or two hundred programs during that one year,</p>
<p>and during some of the denser periods of movie-going we saw many of the</p>
<p>newsreels up to half-a-dozen times since the same weekly one went with</p>
<p>different main pictures and pursued us from town to town. Her favorite kinds</p>
<p>were, in this order: musicals, underworlders, westerners. In the first, real</p>
<p>singers and dancers had unreal stage careers in an essentially grief-proof</p>
<p>sphere of existence wherefrom death and truth were banned, and where, at the</p>
<p>end, white-haired, dewy-eyed, technically deathless, the initially reluctant</p>
<p>father of a show-crazy girl always finished by applauding her apotheosis on</p>
<p>fabulous Broadway. The underworld was a world apart: there, heroic</p>
<p>newspapermen were tortured, telephone bills ran to billions, and, in a</p>
<p>robust atmosphere of incompetent marksmanship, villains were chased through</p>
<p>sewers and store-houses by pathologically fearless cops (I was to give them</p>
<p>less exercise). Finally there was the mahogany landscape, the florid-faced,</p>
<p>blue-eyed roughriders, the prim pretty schoolteacher arriving in Roaring</p>
<p>Gulch, the rearing horse, the spectacular stampede, the pistol thrust</p>
<p>through the shivered windowpane, the stupendous fist fight, the crashing</p>
<p>mountain of dusty old-fashioned furniture, the table used as a weapon, the</p>
<p>timely somersault, the pinned hand still groping for the dropped bowie</p>
<p>knife, the grunt, the sweet crash of fist against chin, the kick in the</p>
<p>belly, the flying tackle; and immediately after a plethora of pain that</p>
<p>would have hospitalized a Hercules (I should know by now), nothing to show</p>
<p>but the rather becoming bruise on the bronzed cheek of the warmed-up hero</p>
<p>embracing his gorgeous frontier bride. I remember one matinee in a small</p>
<p>airless theatre crammed with children and reeking with the hot breath of</p>
<p>popcorn. The moon was yellow above the neckerchiefed crooner, and his finger</p>
<p>was on his strumstring, and his foot was on a pine log, and I had innocently</p>
<p>encircled Lo&#x2019;s shoulder and approached my jawbone to her temple, when two</p>
<p>harpies behind us started muttering the queerest things&#x2013;I do not know if I</p>
<p>understood aright, but what I thought I did, made me withdraw my gentle</p>
<p>hand, and of course the rest of the show was fog to me.</p>
<p> Another jolt I remember is connected with a little burg we were</p>
<p>traversing at night, during our return journey. Some twenty miles earlier I</p>
<p>had happened to tell her that the day school she would attend at Beardsley</p>
<p>was a rather high-class, non-coeducational one, with no modern nonsense,</p>
<p>whereupon Lo treated me to one of those furious harangues of hers where</p>
<p>entreaty and insult, self-assertion and double talk, vicious vulgarity and</p>
<p>childish despair, were interwoven in an exasperating semblance of logic</p>
<p>which prompted a semblance of explanation from me. Enmeshed in her wild</p>
<p>words (swell chance . . . I&#x2019;d be a sap if I took your opinion seriously . .</p>
<p>. Stinker . . . You can&#x2019;t boss me . . . I despise you . . . and so forth), I</p>
<p>drove through the slumbering town at a fifty-mile-per-hour pace in</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (121 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>continuance of my smooth highway swoosh, and a twosome of patrolmen put</p>
<p>their spotlight on the car, and told me to pull over. I shushed Lo who was</p>
<p>automatically raving on. The men peered at her and me with malevolent</p>
<p>curiosity. Suddenly all dimples, she beamed sweetly at them, as she never</p>
<p>did at my orchideous masculinity; for, in a sense, my Lo was even more</p>
<p>scared of the law than I&#x2013;and when the kind officers pardoned us and</p>
<p>servilely we crawled on, her eyelids closed and fluttered as she mimicked</p>
<p>limp prostration.</p>
<p> At this point I have a curious confession to make. You will laugh&#x2013;but</p>
<p>really and truly I somehow never managed to find out quite exactly what the</p>
<p>legal situation was. I do not know it yet. Oh, I have learned a few odds and</p>
<p>ends. Alabama prohibits a guardian from changing the ward&#x2019;s residence</p>
<p>without an order of the court; Minnesota, to whom I take off my hat,</p>
<p>provides that when a relative assumes permanent care and custody of any</p>
<p>child under fourteen, the authority of a court does not come into play.</p>
<p>Query: is the stepfather of a gaspingly adorable pubescent pet, a stepfather</p>
<p>of only one month&#x2019;s standing, a neurotic widower of mature years and small</p>
<p>but independent means, with the parapets of Europe, a divorce and a few</p>
<p>madhouses behind him, is he to be considered a relative, and thus a natural</p>
<p>guardian? And if not, must I, and could I reasonably dare notify some</p>
<p>Welfare Board and file a petition (how do you file a petition?), and have a</p>
<p>court&#x2019;s agent investigate meek, fishy me and dangerous Dolores Haze? The</p>
<p>many books on marriage, rape, adoption and so on, that I guiltily consulted</p>
<p>at the public libraries of big and small towns, told me nothing beyond</p>
<p>darkly insinuating that the state is the super-guardian of minor children.</p>
<p>Pilvin and Zapel, if I remember their names right, in an impressive volume</p>
<p>on the legal side of marriage, completely ignored stepfathers with</p>
<p>motherless girls on their hands and knees. My best friend, a social service</p>
<p>monograph(Chicago, 1936), which was dug out for me at great pains form a</p>
<p>dusty storage recess by an innocent old spinster, said &#x201C;There is no</p>
<p>principle that every minor must have a guardian; the court is passive and</p>
<p>enters the fray only when the child&#x2019;s situation becomes conspicuously</p>
<p>perilous.&#x201D; A guardian, I concluded, was appointed only when he expressed his</p>
<p>solemn and formal desire; but months might elapse before he was given notice</p>
<p>to appear at a hearing and grow his pair of gray wings, and in the meantime</p>
<p>the fair demon child was legally left to her own devices which, after all,</p>
<p>was the case of Dolores Haze. Then came the hearing. A few questions from</p>
<p>the bench, a few reassuring answers from the attorney, a smile, a nod, a</p>
<p>light drizzle outside, and the appointment was made. And still I dared not.</p>
<p>Keep away, be a mouse, curl up in yourhole. Courts became extravagantly</p>
<p>active only when there was some monetary question involved: two greedy</p>
<p>guardians, a robbed orphan, a third, still greedier, party. But here all was</p>
<p>in perfect order, and inventory had been made, and her mother&#x2019;s small</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (122 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>property was waiting untouched for Dolores Haze to grow up. The best policy</p>
<p>seemed to be to refrain from any application. Or would some busybody, some</p>
<p>Humane Society, butt in if I kept too quiet?</p>
<p> Friend Farlow, who was a lawyer of sorts and ought to have been able to</p>
<p>give me some solid advice, was too much occupied with Jean&#x2019;s cancer to do</p>
<p>anything more than what he had promised&#x2013;namely, to look after Chrlotte&#x2019;s</p>
<p>meager estate while I recovered very gradually from the shock of her death.</p>
<p>I had conditioned him into believing Dolores was my natural child, and so</p>
<p>could not expect him to bother his head about the situation. I am, as the</p>
<p>reader must have gathered by now, a poor businessman; but neither ignorance</p>
<p>nor indolence should have prevented me from seeking professional advice</p>
<p>elsewhere. What stopped me was the awful feeling that if I meddled with fate</p>
<p>in any way and tried to rationalize her fantastic gift, that gift would be</p>
<p>snatched away like that palace on the mountain top in the Oriental tale</p>
<p>which vanished whenever a prospective owner asked its custodian how come a</p>
<p>strip of sunset sky was clearly visible from afar between black rock and</p>
<p>foundation.</p>
<p> I decided that at Beardsley (the site of Bearsley College for Women) I</p>
<p>would have access to works of reference that I had not yet been able to</p>
<p>study, such as Woerner&#x2019;s Treatise &#x201C;On the American Law of Guardianship&#x201D; and</p>
<p>certain United States Children&#x2019;s Bureau Publications. I also decided that</p>
<p>anything was better for Lo than the demoralizing idleness in which she</p>
<p>lived. I could persuade her to do so many things&#x2013;their list might stupefy</p>
<p>a professional educator; but no matter how I pleaded or stormed, I could</p>
<p>never make her read any other book than the so-called comic books or stories</p>
<p>in magazines for American females. Any literature a peg higher smacked to</p>
<p>her of school, and though theoretically willing to enjoy A Girl of the</p>
<p>Limberlost or the Arabian Nights, or Little Women, she was</p>
<p>quite sure she would not fritter away her &#x201C;vacation&#x201D; on such highbrow</p>
<p>reading matter.</p>
<p> I now think it was a great mistake to move east again and have her go</p>
<p>to that private school in Beardsley, instead of somehow scrambling across</p>
<p>the Mexican border while the scrambling was good so as to lie low for a</p>
<p>couple of years in subtropical bliss until I could safely marry my little</p>
<p>Creole; for I must confess that depending on the condition of my glands and</p>
<p>ganglia, I could switch in the course of the same day from one pole of</p>
<p>insanity to the other&#x2013;from the thought that around 1950 I would have to get</p>
<p>rid somehow of a difficult adolescent whose magic nymphage had</p>
<p>evaporated&#x2013;to the thought that with patience and luck might have her</p>
<p>produce eventually a nymphet with my blood in her exquisite veins, a Lolita</p>
<p>the Second, who would be eight or nine around 1960, when I would still be</p>

<p>encore vert&#x2013;or was it green rot?&#x2013;bizarre, tender, salivating Dr.</p>
<p>Humbert, practicing on supremely lovely Lolita the Third the art of being a</p>
<p>granddad.</p>
<p> In the days of that wild journey of ours, I doubted not that as father</p>
<p>to Lolita the First I was a ridiculous failure. I did my best; I read and</p>
<p>reread a book with the unintentionally biblical title Know Your Own</p>
<p>Daughter, which I got at the same store where I bought Lo, for her</p>
<p>thirteenth birthday, a de luxe volume with commercially &#x201C;beautiful&#x201D;</p>
<p>illustrations, of Andersen&#x2019;s The Little Mermaid. But even at our very</p>
<p>best moments, when we sat reading on a rainy day (Lo&#x2019;s glance skipping from</p>
<p>the window to her wrist watch and back again), or had a quiet hearty meal in</p>
<p>a crowded diner, or played a childish game of cards, or went shopping, or</p>
<p>silently stared, with other motorists and their children, at some smashed,</p>
<p>blood-bespattered car with a young woman&#x2019;s shoe in the ditch (Lo, as we</p>
<p>drove on: &#x201C;that was the exact type of moccasin I was trying to describe to</p>
<p>that jerk in the store&#x201D;); on all those random occasions, I seemed to myself</p>
<p>as implausible a father as she seemed to be a daughter. Was, perhaps, guilty</p>
<p>locomotion instrumental in vitiating our powers of impersonation? Would</p>
<p>improvement be forthcoming with a fixed domicile and a routine schoolgirl&#x2019;s</p>
<p>day?</p>
<p> In my choice of Beardsley I was guided not only by the fact of there</p>
<p>being a comparatively sedate school for girls located there, but also by the</p>
<p>presence of the women&#x2019;s college. In my desire to get myself cas&#xE8;, to</p>
<p>attach myself somehow to some patterned surface which my stripes would blend</p>
<p>with, I thought of a man I knew in the department of French at Beardsley</p>
<p>College; he was good enough to use my textbook in his classes and had</p>
<p>attempted to get me over once to deliver a lecture. I had no intention of</p>
<p>doing so, since, as I have once remarked in the course of these confessions,</p>
<p>there are few physiques I loathe more than the heavy low-slung pelvis, thick</p>
<p>calves and deplorable complexion of the average coed (in whom I see, maybe,</p>
<p>the coffin of coarse female flesh within which my nymphets are buried</p>
<p>alive); but I did crave for a label, a background, and a simulacrum, and, as</p>
<p>presently will become clear, there was a reason, a rather zany reason, why</p>
<p>old Gaston Godin&#x2019;s company would be particularly safe.</p>
<p> Finally, there was the money question. My income was cracking under the</p>
<p>strain of our joy-ride. True, I clung to the cheaper motor courts; but every</p>
<p>now and then, there would be a loud hotel de luxe, or a pretentious dude</p>
<p>ranch, to mutilate our budget; staggering sums, moreover, were expended on</p>
<p>sightseeing and Lo&#x2019;s clothes, and the old Haze bus, although a still</p>
<p>vigorous and very devoted machine, necessitated numerous minor and major</p>
<p>repairs. In one of our strip maps that has happened to survive among the</p>
<p>papers which the authorities have so kindly allowed me to use for the</p>
<p>purpose of writing my statement, I find some jottings that help me compute</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (124 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>the following. During that extravagant year 1947-1948, August to August,</p>
<p>lodgings and food cost us around 5,500 dollars; gas, oil and repairs,</p>
<p>1,234, and various extras almost as much; so that during about 150 days of</p>
<p>actual motion (we covered about 27,000 miles!) plus some 200 days of</p>
<p>interpolated standstills, this modest rentier spent around 8,000</p>
<p>dollars, or better say 10,000 because, unpractical as I am, I have surely</p>
<p>forgotten a number of items.</p>
<p> And so we rolled East, I more devastated than braced with the</p>
<p>satisfaction of my passion, and she glowing with health, her bi-iliac</p>
<p>garland still as brief as a lad&#x2019;s, although she had added two inches to her</p>
<p>stature and eight pounds to her weight. We had been everywhere. We had</p>
<p>really seen nothing. And I catch myself thinking that our long journey had</p>
<p>only defiled with a sinuous trail of slime the lovely, trustful, dreamy,</p>
<p>enormous country that by then, in retrospect, was no more to us than a</p>
<p>collection of dog-eared maps, ruined tour books, old tires, and her sobs in</p>
<p>the night&#x2013;every night, every night&#x2013;the moment I feigned sleep.</p>
<p> 4</p>
<p> When, through decorations of light and shade, we drove to 14 Thayer</p>
<p>Street, a grave little lad met us with the keys and a note from Gaston who</p>
<p>had rented the house for us. My Lo, without granting her new surroundings</p>
<p>one glance, unseeingly turned on the radio to which instinct led her and lay</p>
<p>down on the living room sofa with a batch of old magazines which in the same</p>
<p>precise and blind manner she landed by dipping her hand into the nether</p>
<p>anatomy of a lamp table.</p>
<p> I really did not mind where to dwell provided I could lock my Lolita up</p>
<p>somewhere; but I had, I suppose, in the course of my correspondence with</p>
<p>vague Gaston, vaguely visualized a house of ivied brick. Actually the place</p>
<p>bore a dejected resemblance to the Haze home (a mere 400 distant): it was</p>
<p>the same sort of dull gray frame affair with a shingled roof and dull green</p>
<p>drill awnings; and the rooms, though smaller and furnished in a more</p>
<p>consistent plush-and-plate style, were arranged in much the same order. My</p>
<p>study turned out to be, however, a much larger room, lined from floor to</p>
<p>ceiling with some two thousand books on chemistry which my landlord (on</p>
<p>sabbatical leave for the time being) taught at Beardsley College.</p>
<p> I had hoped Beardsley School for girls, an expensive day school, with</p>
<p>lunch thrown in and a glamorous gymnasium, would, while cultivating all</p>
<p>those young bodies, provide some formal education for their minds as well.</p>
<p>Gaston Godin, who was seldom right in his judgment of American habitus, had</p>
<p>warned me that the institution might turn out to be one of those where girls</p>
<p>are taught, as he put it with a foreigner&#x2019;s love for such things: &#x201C;not to</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (125 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>spell very well, but to smell very well.&#x201D; I don&#x2019;t think they achieved even</p>
<p>that.</p>
<p> At my first interview with headmistress Pratt, she approved of my</p>
<p>child&#x2019;s &#x201C;nice blue eyes&#x201D; (blue! Lolita!) and of my own friendship with that</p>
<p>&#x201C;French genius&#x201D; (a genius! Gaston!)&#x2013;and then, having turned Dolly over to a</p>
<p>Miss Cormorant, she wrinkled her brow in a kind of recueillement and</p>
<p>said:</p>
<p> &#x201C;We are not so much concerned, Mr. Humbird, with having our students</p>
<p>become bookworms or be able to reel off all the capitals of Europe which</p>
<p>nobody knows anyway, or learn by heart the dates of forgotten battles. What</p>
<p>we are concerned with is the adjustment of the child to group life. This is</p>
<p>why we stress the four D&#x2019;s: Dramatics, Dance, Debating and Dating. We are</p>
<p>confronted by certain facts. Your delightful Dolly will presently enter an</p>
<p>age group where dates, dating, date dress, date book, date etiquette, mean as</p>
<p>much to her as, say, business, business connections, business success, mean</p>
<p>to you, or as much as [smiling] the happiness of my girls means to me.</p>
<p>Dorothy Humbird is already involved in a whole system of social life which</p>
<p>consists, whether we like it or not, of hot-dog stands, corner drugstores,</p>
<p>malts and cokes, movies, square-dancing, blanket parties on beaches, and</p>
<p>even hair-fixing parties! Naturally at Beardsley School we disapprove of</p>
<p>some of these activities; and we rechannel others into more constructive</p>
<p>directions. But we do try to turn our backs on the fog and squarely face the</p>
<p>sunshine. To put it briefly, while adopting certain teaching techniques, we</p>
<p>are more interested in communication than in composition. That is, with due</p>
<p>respect to Shakespeare and others, we want our girls to communicate</p>
<p>freely with the live world around them rather than plunge into musty old</p>
<p>books. We are still groping perhaps, but we grope intelligently, like a</p>
<p>gynecologist feeling a tumor. We thing, Dr. Humburg, in organissmal and</p>
<p>organizational terms. We have done away with the mass or irrelevant topics</p>
<p>that have traditionally been presented to young girls, leaving no place, in</p>
<p>former days, for the knowledges and the skills, and the attitudes they will</p>
<p>need in managing their lives and&#x2013;as the cynic might add&#x2013;the lives of their</p>
<p>husbands. Mr. Humberson, let us put it this way: the position of a star is</p>
<p>important, but the most practical spot for an icebox in the kitchen may be</p>
<p>even more important to the budding housewife. You say that all you expect a</p>
<p>child to obtain from school is a sound education. But what do we mean by</p>
<p>education? In the old days it was in the main a verbal phenomenon; I mean,</p>
<p>you could have a child learn by heart a good encyclopedia and he or she</p>
<p>would know as much as or more than a school could offer. Dr. Hummer, do you</p>
<p>realize that for the modern pre-adolescent child, medieval dates are of less</p>
<p>vital value than weekend ones [twinkle]?&#x2013;to repeat a pun that I heard the</p>
<p>Beardsley college psychoanalyst permit herself the other day. We live not</p>
<p>only in a world of thoughts, but also in a world of things. Wrds without</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (126 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>experience are meaningless. What on earth can Dorothy Hummerson care for</p>
<p>Greece and the Orient with their harems and slaves?&#x201D;</p>
<p> This program rather appalled me, but I spoke to two intelligent ladies</p>
<p>who had been connected with the school, and they affirmed that the girls did</p>
<p>quite a bit of sound reading and that the &#x201C;communication&#x201D; line was more or</p>
<p>less ballyhoo aimed at giving old-fashioned Beardsley School a financially</p>
<p>remunerative modern touch, though actually it remained as prim as a prawn.</p>
<p> Another reason attracting me to that particular school may seem funny</p>
<p>to some readers, but it was very important to me, for that is the way I am</p>
<p>made. Across our street, exactly in front of our house, there was, I</p>
<p>noticed, a gap of weedy wasteland, with some colorful bushes and a pile of</p>
<p>bricks and a few scattered planks, and the foam of shabby mauve and chrome</p>
<p>autumn roadside flowers; and through that gap you could see a shimmery</p>
<p>section of School Rd., running parallel to our Thayer St., and immediately</p>
<p>beyond that, the playground of the school Apart from the psychological</p>
<p>comfort this general arrangement should afford me by keeping Dolly&#x2019;s day</p>
<p>adjacent to mine, I immediately foresaw the pleasure I would have in</p>
<p>distinguishing from my study-bedroom, by means of powerful binoculars, the</p>
<p>statistically inevitable percentage of nymphets among the other girl</p>
<p>children playing around Dolly during recess; unfortunately, on the very</p>
<p>first day of school, workmen arrived and put up a fence some way down the</p>
<p>gap, and in no time a construction of tawny wood maliciously arose beyond</p>
<p>that fence utterly blocking my magic vista; and as soon as they had erected</p>
<p>a sufficient amount of material to spoil everything, those absurd builders</p>
<p>suspended their work and never appeared again.</p>
<p> 5</p>
<p> In a street called Thayer Street, in the residential green, fawn, and</p>
<p>golden of a mellow academic townlet, one was bound to have a few amiable</p>
<p>fine-dayers yelping at you. I prided myself on the exact temperature of my</p>
<p>relations with them: never rude, always aloof. My west-door neighbor, who</p>
<p>might have been a businessman or a college teacher, or both, would speak to</p>
<p>me once in a while as he barbered some late garden blooms or watered his</p>
<p>car, or, at a later date, defrosted his driveway (I don&#x2019;t mind if these</p>
<p>verbs are all wrong), but my brief grunts, just sufficiently articulate to</p>
<p>sound like conventional assents or interrogative pause-fillers, precluded</p>
<p>any evolution toward chumminess. Of the two houses flanking the bit of</p>
<p>scrubby waste opposite, one was closed, and the other contained two</p>
<p>professors of English, tweedy and short-haired Miss Lester and fadedly</p>
<p>feminine Miss Fabian, whose only subject of brief sidewalk conversation with</p>
<p>me was (God bless their tact!) the young loveliness of my daughter and the</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (127 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>na&#xEE;ve charm of Gaston Godin. My east-door neighbor was by far the most</p>
<p>dangerous one, a sharp-nosed stock character whose late brother had been</p>
<p>attached to the College as Superintendent of Buildings and Grounds. I</p>
<p>remember her waylaying Dolly, while I stood at the living room window,</p>
<p>feverishly awaiting my darling&#x2019;s return from school. The odious spinster,</p>
<p>trying to conceal her morbid inquisitiveness under a mask of dulcet</p>
<p>goodwill, stood leaning on her slim umbrella (the sleet had just stopped, a</p>
<p>cold wet sun had sidled out), and Dolly, her brown coat open despite the raw</p>
<p>weather, her structural heap of books pressed against her stomach, her knees</p>
<p>showing pink above her clumsy wellingtons, a sheepish frightened little</p>
<p>smile flitting over and off her snub-nosed face, which&#x2013;owing perhaps to the</p>
<p>pale wintry light&#x2013;looked almost plain, in a rustic, German,</p>
<p>m&#xE4;gdlein-like way, as she stood there and dealt with Miss East&#x2019;s</p>
<p>questions &#x201C;And where is your mother, my dear? And what is your poor father&#x2019;s</p>
<p>occupation? And where did you love before?&#x201D; Another time the loathsome</p>
<p>creature accosted me with a welcoming whine&#x2013;but I evaded her; and a few</p>
<p>days later there came from her a note in a blue-margined envelope, a nice</p>
<p>mixture of poison and treacle, suggesting Dolly come over on a Sunday and</p>
<p>curl up in a chair to look through the &#x201C;loads of beautiful books my dear</p>
<p>mother gave me when I was a child, instead of having the radio on at full</p>
<p>blast till all hours of the night.&#x201D;</p>
<p> I had also to be careful in regard to a Mrs. Holigan, a charwoman and</p>
<p>cook of sorts whom I had inherited with the vacuum cleaner from the previous</p>
<p>tenants. Dolly got lunch at school, so that this was no trouble, and I had</p>
<p>become adept at providing her with a big breakfast and warming up the dinner</p>
<p>that Mrs. Holigan prepared before leaving. That kindly and harmless woman</p>
<p>had, thank God, a rather bleary eye that missed details, and I had become a</p>
<p>great expert in bedmaking; but still I was continuously obsessed by the</p>
<p>feeling that some fatal stain had been left somewhere, or that, on the rare</p>
<p>occasions where Holigan&#x2019;s presence happened to coincide with Lo&#x2019;s, simple Lo</p>
<p>might succumb to buxom sympathy in the course of a cozy kitchen chat. I</p>
<p>often felt we lived in a lighted house of glass, and any moment some</p>
<p>thin-lipped parchment face would peer through a carelessly unshaded window</p>
<p>to obtain a free glimpse of things that the most jaded voyeur would</p>
<p>have paid a small fortune to watch.</p>
<p> 6</p>
<p> A word about Gaston Godin. The main reason why I enjoyed&#x2013;or at least</p>
<p>tolerated with relief&#x2013;his company was the spell of absolute security that</p>
<p>his ample person cast on my secret. Not that he knew it; I had no special</p>
<p>reason to confide in him, and he was much too self-centered and abstract to</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (128 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>notice or suspect anything that might lead to a frank question on his part</p>
<p>and a frank answer on mine. He spoke well of me to Beardsleyans, he was my</p>
<p>good herald. Had he discovered mes go&#xF8;ts and Lolita&#x2019;s status, it</p>
<p>would have interested him only insofar as throwing some light on the</p>
<p>simplicity of my attitude towards him, which attitude was as free of</p>
<p>polite strain as it was of ribald allusions; for despite his colorless mind</p>
<p>and dim memory, he was perhaps aware that I knew more about him than the</p>
<p>burghers of Beardsley did. He was a flabby, dough-faced, melancholy bachelor</p>
<p>tapering upward to a pair of narrow, not quite level shoulders and a conical</p>
<p>pear-head which had sleek black hair on one side and only a few plastered</p>
<p>wisps on the other. But the lower part of his body was enormous, and he</p>
<p>ambulated with a curious elephantine stealth by means of phenomenally stout</p>
<p>legs. He always wore black, even his tie was black; he seldom bathed; his</p>
<p>English was a burlesque. And, nonetheless, everybody considered him to be a</p>
<p>supremely lovable, lovably freakish fellow! Neighbors pampered him; he knew</p>
<p>by name all the small boys in our vicinity (he lived a few blocks away from</p>
<p>me)and had some of them clean his sidewalk and burn leaves in his back yard,</p>
<p>and bring wood from his shed, and even perform simple chores about the</p>
<p>house, and he would feed them fancy chocolates, with real liqueurs</p>
<p>inside&#x2013;in the privacy of an orientally furnished den in his basement, with</p>
<p>amusing daggers and pistols arrayed on the moldy, rug-adorned walls among</p>
<p>the camouflaged hot-water pipes. Upstairs he had a studio&#x2013;he painted a</p>
<p>little, the old fraud. He had decorated its sloping wall (it was really not</p>
<p>more than a garret) with large photographs of pensive Andr&#xE8; Gide,</p>
<p>Tcha&#xEE;kovsky, Norman Douglas, two other well-known English writers, Nijinsky</p>
<p>(all thighs and fig leaves), Harold D. Doublename (a misty-eyed left-wing</p>
<p>professor at a Midwesten university) and Marcel Proust. All these poor</p>
<p>people seemed about to fall on you from their inclined plane. He had also an</p>
<p>album with snapshots of all the Jackies and Dickies of the neighborhood, and</p>
<p>when I happened to thumb through it and make some casual remark, Gaston</p>
<p>would purse his fat lips and murmur with a wistful pout &#x201C;Oui, ils sont</p>
<p>gentils.&#x201D; His brown eyes would roam around the various sentimental and</p>
<p>artistic bric-a-brac present, and his own banal toiles (the</p>
<p>conventionally primitive eyes, sliced guitars, blue nipples and geometrical</p>
<p>designs of the day), and with a vague gesture toward a painted wooden bowl</p>
<p>or veined vase, he would say &#x201C;Prenez donc une de ces poires. La bonne</p>
<p>dame d&#x2019;en face m&#x2019;en offre plus que je n&#x2019;en peux savourer.&#x201D; Or:</p>
<p>&#x201C;Mississe Taille Lore vient de me donner ces dahlias, belles fleurs que</p>
<p>j&#x2019;ex&#xF5;cre.&#x201D; (Somber, sad, full of world-weariness.)</p>
<p> For obvious reasons, I preferred myhouse to his for the games of chess</p>
<p>we had two or three times weekly. He looked like some old battered idol as</p>
<p>he sat with his pudgy hands in his lap and stared at the board as if it were</p>
<p>a corpse. Wheezing he would mediate for ten minutes&#x2013;then make a losing</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (129 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>move. Or the good man, after even more thought, might utter: Au roi!</p>
<p>With a slow old-dog woof that had a gargling sound at the back of it which</p>
<p>made his jowls wabble; and then he would lift his circumflex eyebrows with a</p>
<p>deep sigh as I pointed out to him that he was in check himself.</p>
<p> Sometimes, from where we sat in my cold study I could hear Lo&#x2019;s bare</p>
<p>feet practicing dance techniques in the living room downstairs; but Gaston&#x2019;s</p>
<p>outgoing senses were comfortably dulled, and he remained unaware of those</p>
<p>naked rhythms&#x2013;and-one, and-two, and-one, and-two, weight transferred on a</p>
<p>straight right leg, leg up and out to the side, and-one, and-two, and only</p>
<p>when she started jumping, opening her legs at the height of the jump, and</p>
<p>flexing one leg, and extending the other, and flying, and landing on her</p>
<p>toes&#x2013;only then did my pale, pompous, morose opponent rub his head or cheek</p>
<p>a if confusing those distant thuds with the awful stabs of my formidable</p>
<p>Queen.</p>
<p> Sometimes Lola would slouch in while we pondered the board&#x2013;and it was</p>
<p>every time a treat to see Gaston, his elephant eye still fixed on his</p>
<p>pieces, ceremoniously rise to shake hands with her, and forthwith release</p>
<p>her limp fingers, and without looking once at her, descend again into his</p>
<p>chair to topple into the trap I had laid for him. One day around Christmas,</p>
<p>after I had not seen him for a fortnight or so, he asked me &#x201C;Et toutes</p>
<p>vos fillettes, elles vont bien?&#x201D; from which it became evident to</p>
<p>me that he had multiplied my unique Lolita by the number of sartorial</p>
<p>categories his downcast moody eye had glimpsed during a whole series of her</p>
<p>appearances: blue jeans, a skirt, shorts, a quilted robe.</p>
<p> I am loath to dwell so long on the poor fellow (sadly enough, a year</p>
<p>later, during a voyage to Europe, from which he did not return, he got</p>
<p>involved in a sale histoire, in Napes of all places!). I would have</p>
<p>hardly alluded to him at all had not his Beardsley existence had such a</p>
<p>queer bearing on my case. I need him for my defense. There he was devoid of</p>
<p>any talent whatsoever, a mediocre teacher, a worthless scholar, a glum</p>
<p>repulsive fat old invert, highly contemptuous of the American way of life,</p>
<p>triumphantly ignorant of the English language&#x2013;there he was in priggish New</p>
<p>England, crooned over by the old and caressed by the young&#x2013;oh, having a</p>
<p>grand time and fooling everybody; and here was I.</p>
<p> 7</p>
<p> I am now faced with the distasteful task of recording a definite drop</p>
<p>in Lolita&#x2019;s morals. If her share in the ardors she kindled had never</p>
<p>amounted to much, neither had pure lucre ever come to the fore. But I was</p>
<p>weak, I was not wise, my school-girl nymphet had me in thrall. With the</p>
<p>human element dwindling, the passion, the tenderness, and the torture only</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (130 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>increased; and of this she took advantage.</p>
<p> Her weekly allowance, paid to her under condition she fulfill her basic</p>
<p>obligations, was twenty-one cents at the start of the Beardsley era&#x2013;and</p>
<p>went up to one dollar five before its end. This was a more than generous</p>
<p>arrangement seeing she constantly received from me all kinds of small</p>
<p>presents and had for the asking any sweetmeat or movie under the</p>
<p>moon&#x2013;although, of course, I might fondly demand an additional kiss, or even</p>
<p>a whole collection of assorted caresses, when I knew she coveted very badly</p>
<p>some item of juvenile amusement. She was, however, not easy to deal with.</p>
<p>Only very listlessly did she earn her three pennies&#x2013;or three nickels&#x2013;per</p>
<p>day; and she proved to be a cruel negotiator whenever it was in her power to</p>
<p>deny me certain life-wrecking, strange, slow paradisal philters without</p>
<p>which I could not live more than a few days in a row, and which, because of</p>
<p>the very nature of love&#x2019;s languor, I could not obtain by force. Knowing the</p>
<p>magic and might of her own soft mouth, she managed&#x2013;during one</p>
<p>schoolyear!&#x2013;to raise the bonus price of a fancy embrace to three, and even</p>
<p>four bucks! O Reader! Laugh not, as you imagine me, on the very rack of joy</p>
<p>noisily emitting dimes and quarters, and great big silver dollars like some</p>
<p>sonorous, jingly and wholly demented machine vomiting riches; and in the</p>
<p>margin of that leaping epilepsy she would firmly clutch a handful of coins</p>
<p>in her little fist, which, anyway, I used to pry open afterwards unless she</p>
<p>gave me the slip, scrambling away to hide her loot. And just as every other</p>
<p>day I would cruise all around the school area and on comatose feet visit</p>
<p>drugstores, and peer into foggy lanes, and listen to receding girl laughter</p>
<p>in between my heart throbs and the falling leaves, so every now and then I</p>
<p>would burgle her room and scrutinize torn papers in the wastebasket with the</p>
<p>painted roses, and look under the pillow of the virginal bed I had just made</p>
<p>myself. Once I found eight one-dollar notes in one of her books</p>
<p>(fittingly&#x2013;Treasure Island), and once a hole in the wall behind</p>
<p>Whistler&#x2019;s Mother yielded as much as twenty-four dollars and some</p>
<p>change&#x2013;say twenty-four sixty&#x2013;which I quietly removed, upon which, next</p>
<p>day, she accused, to my face, honest Mrs. Holigan of being a filthy thief.</p>
<p>Eventually, she lived up to her I.Q. by finding a safer hoarding place which</p>
<p>I never discovered; but by that time I had brought prices down drastically</p>
<p>by having her earn the hard and nauseous way permission to participate in</p>
<p>the school&#x2019;s theatrical program; because what I feared most was not that she</p>
<p>might ruin me, but that she might accumulate sufficient cash to run away. I</p>
<p>believe the poor fierce-eyed child had figured out that with a mere fifty</p>
<p>dollars in her purse she might somehow reach Broadway or Hollywood&#x2013;or the</p>
<p>foul kitchen of a diner (Help Wanted) in a dismal ex-prairie state, with the</p>
<p>wind blowing, and the stars blinking, and the cars, and the bars, and the</p>
<p>barmen, and everything soiled, torn, dead.</p>

<p> I did my best, your Honor, to tackele the problem of boys. Oh, I used</p>
<p>even to read in the Beardsley Star a so-called Column for Teens, to find out</p>
<p>how to behave!</p>
<p> A word to fathers. Don&#x2019;t frighten away daughter&#x2019;s friend. Maybe it</p>
<p>is a bit hard for you to realize that now the boys are finding her</p>
<p>attractive. To you she is still a little girl. To the boys she&#x2019;s charming</p>
<p>and fun, lovely and gay. They like her. Today you clinch big deals in an</p>
<p>executive&#x2019;s office, but yesterday you were just highschool Jim carrying</p>
<p>Jane&#x2019;s school books. Remember? Don&#x2019;t you want your daughter, now that her</p>
<p>turn has come, to be happy in the admiration and company of boys she likes?</p>
<p>Don&#x2019;t you want your daughter, now that her turn has come, to be happy in the</p>
<p>admiration and company of boys she likes? Don&#x2019;t you want them to have</p>
<p>wholesome fun together?</p>
<p> Wholesome fun? Good Lord!</p>
<p> Why not treat the young fellows as guests in your house? Why not</p>
<p>make conversation with them? Draw them out, make them laugh and feel at</p>
<p>ease?</p>
<p> Welcome, fellow, to this bordello.</p>
<p> If she breaks the rules don&#x2019;t explode out loud in front of her</p>
<p>partner in crime. Let her take the brunt of your displeasure in private. And</p>
<p>stop making the boys feel she&#x2019;s the daughter of an old ogre.</p>
<p> First of all the old ogre drew up a list under &#x201C;absolutely forbidden&#x201D;</p>
<p>and another under &#x201C;reluctantly allowed.&#x201D; Absolutely forbidden were dates,</p>
<p>single or double or triple&#x2013;the next step being of course mass orgy. She</p>
<p>might visit a candy bar with her girl friends, and there giggle-chat with</p>
<p>occasional young males, while I waited in the car at a discreet distance;</p>
<p>and I promised her that if her group were invited by a socially acceptable</p>
<p>group in Butler&#x2019;s Academy for Bo[ys for their annual ball (heavily</p>
<p>chaperoned, of course), I might consider the question whether a girl of</p>
<p>fourteen can don her first &#x201C;formal&#x201D; (a kind of gown that makes thin-armed</p>
<p>teen-agers look like flamingoes). Moreover, I promised her to throw a party</p>
<p>a t our house to which she would be allowed to invite her prettier girl</p>
<p>friends and the nicer boys she would have met by that time at the Butler</p>
<p>dance. But I was quite positive that as long as my regime lasted she would</p>

<p>never, never be permitted to go with a youngster in rut to a movie, or neck</p>
<p>in a car, or go to boy-girl parties at the houses of schoolmates, or indulge</p>
<p>out of my earshot in boy-girl telephone conversations, even if &#x201C;only</p>
<p>discussing his relations with a friend of mine.&#x201D;</p>
<p> Lo was enraged by all this&#x2013;called me a lousy crook and worse&#x2013;and I</p>
<p>would probably have lost my temper had I not soon discovered, to my sweetest</p>
<p>relief, that what really angered her was my depriving her not of a specific</p>
<p>satisfaction but of a general right. I was impinging, you see, on the</p>
<p>conventional program, the stock pastimes, the &#x201C;things that are done,&#x201D; the</p>
<p>routine of youth; for there is nothing more conservative than a child,</p>
<p>especially a girl-child, be she the most auburn and russet, the most</p>
<p>mythopoeic nymphet in October&#x2019;s orchard-haze.</p>
<p> Do not misunderstand me. I cannot be absolutely certain that in the</p>
<p>course of the winter she did not manage to have, in a casual way, improper</p>
<p>contacts with unknown young fellows; of course, no matter how closely I</p>
<p>controlled her leisure, there would constantly occur unaccounted-for time</p>
<p>leaks with over-elaborate explanations to stop them up in retrospect; of</p>
<p>course, my jealousy would constantly catch its jagged claw in the fine</p>
<p>fabrics of nymphet falsity; but I did definitely feel&#x2013;and can now vouchsafe</p>
<p>for the accuracy of my feeling&#x2013;that there was no reason for serious alarm.</p>
<p>I felt that way not because I never once discovered any palpable hard young</p>
<p>throat to crush among the masculine mutes that flickered somewhere in the</p>
<p>background; but because it was to me &#x201C;overwhelmingly obvious&#x201D; (a favorite</p>
<p>expression with my aunt Sybil) that all varieties of high school boys&#x2013;from</p>
<p>the perspiring nincompoop whom &#x201C;holding hands&#x201D; thrills, to the</p>
<p>self-sufficient rapist with pustules and a souped-up car&#x2013;equally bored my</p>
<p>sophisticated young mistress. &#x201C;All this noise about boys gags me,&#x201D; she had</p>
<p>scrawled on the inside of a schoolbook, and underneath, in Mona&#x2019;s hand (Mona</p>
<p>is due any minute now), there was the sly quip: &#x201C;What about Rigger?&#x201D; (due</p>
<p>too).</p>
<p> Faceless, then, are the chappies I happened to see in her company.</p>
<p>There was for instance Red Sweater who one day, the day we had the first</p>
<p>snow&#x2013;saw her home; from the parlor window I observed them talking near our</p>
<p>porch. She wre her first cloth coat with a fur collar; there was a small</p>
<p>brown cap on my favorite hairdo&#x2013;the fringe in front and the swirl at the</p>
<p>sides and the natural curls at the back&#x2013;and her damp-dark moccasins and</p>
<p>white socks were more sloppy than ever. She pressed as usual her books to</p>
<p>her chest while speaking or listening, and her feet gestured all the time:</p>
<p>she would stand on her left instep with her right toe, remove it backward,</p>
<p>cross her feet, rock slightly, sketch a few steps, and then start the series</p>
<p>all over again. There was Windbreaker who talked to her in front of a</p>
<p>restaurant one Sunday afternoon while his mother and sister attempted to</p>
<p>walk me away for a chat; I dragged along and looked back at my only love.</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (133 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>She had developed more than one conventional mannerism, such as the polite</p>
<p>adolescent way of showing one is literally &#x201C;doubled up&#x201D; with laughter by</p>
<p>inclining one&#x2019;s head, and so (as she sensed my call), still feigning helpless</p>
<p>merriment, she walked backward a couple of steps, and then faced about, and</p>
<p>walked toward me with a fading smile. On the other hand, I greatly</p>
<p>liked&#x2013;perhaps because it reminded me of her first unforgettable</p>
<p>confession&#x2013;her trick of sighing &#x201C;oh dear!&#x201D; in humorous wistful submission</p>
<p>to fate, or emitting a long &#x201C;no-o&#x201D; in a deep almost growling undertone when</p>
<p>the blow of fate had actually fallen. Above all&#x2013;since we are speaking of</p>
<p>movement and youth&#x2013;I liked to see her spinning up and down Thayer Street on</p>
<p>her beautiful young bicycle: rising on the pedals to work on them lustily,</p>
<p>then sinking back in a languid posture while the speed wore itself off; and</p>
<p>then she would stop at our mailbox and, still astride, would flip through a</p>
<p>magazine she found there, and put it back, and press her tongue to one side</p>
<p>of her upper lip and push off with her foot, and again sprint through pale</p>
<p>shade and sun.</p>
<p> On the whole she seemed to me better adapted to her surroundings than I</p>
<p>had hoped she would be when considering my spoiled slave-child and the</p>
<p>bangles of demeanor she na&#xEE;vely affected the winter before in california.</p>
<p>Although I could never get used to the constant state of anxiety in which</p>
<p>the guilty, the great, the tenderhearted live, I felt I was doing my best in</p>
<p>the way of mimicry. As I lay on my narrow studio bed after a session of</p>
<p>adoration and despair in Lolita&#x2019;s cold bedroom, I used to review the</p>
<p>concluded day by checking my own image as it prowled rather than passed</p>
<p>before the mind&#x2019;s red eye. I watched dark-and-handsome, not un-Celtic,</p>
<p>probably high-church, possibly very high-church, Dr. Humbert see his</p>
<p>daughter off to school I watched him greet with his slow smile and</p>
<p>pleasantly arched thick black ad-eyebrows good Mrs. Holigan, who smelled of</p>
<p>the plague (and would head, I knew, for master&#x2019;s gin at the first</p>
<p>opportunity). With Mr. West, retired executioner or writer of religious</p>
<p>tracts&#x2013;who cared?&#x2013;I saw neighbor what&#x2019;s his name, I think they are French</p>
<p>or Swiss, meditate in his frank-windowed study over a typewriter, rather</p>
<p>gaunt-profiled, an almost Hitlerian cowlick on his pale brow. Weekends,</p>
<p>wearing a well-tailored overcoat and brown gloves, Professor H. might be</p>
<p>seen with his daughter strolling to Walton Inn (famous for its</p>
<p>violet-ribboned china bunnies and chocolate boxes among which you sit and</p>
<p>wait for a &#x201C;table for two&#x201D; still filthy with your predecessor&#x2019;s crumbs).</p>
<p>Seen on weekdays, around one p.m. , saluting with dignity Argus-eyed East</p>
<p>while maneuvering the car out of the garage and around the damned</p>
<p>evergreens, and down onto the slippery road. Raising a cold eye from book to</p>
<p>clock in the positively sultry Beardsley College library, among bulky young</p>
<p>women caught and petrified in the overflow of human knowledge. Walking</p>
<p>across the campus with the college clergyman, the Rev. Rigger (who also</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (134 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>taught Bible in Beardsley School). &#x201C;Somebody told me her mother was a</p>
<p>celebrated actress killed in an airplane accident. Oh? My mistake, I</p>
<p>presume. Is that so? I see. How sad.&#x201D; (Sublimating her mother, eh?) Slowly</p>
<p>pushing my little pram through the labyrinth of the supermarket, in the wake</p>
<p>of Professor W., also a slow-moving and gentle widower with the eyes of a</p>
<p>goat. Shoveling the snow in my shirt-sleeves, a voluminous black and white</p>
<p>muffler around my neck. Following with no show of rapacious haste (even</p>
<p>taking time to wipe my feet on the mat) my school-girl daughter into the</p>
<p>house. Taking Dolly to the dentist&#x2013;pretty nurse beaming at her&#x2013;old</p>
<p>magazines&#x2013;ne montrez pas vos zhambes. At dinner with Dolly in town,</p>
<p>Mr. Edgar H. Humbert was seen eating his steak in the continental</p>
<p>knife-and-fork manner. Enjoying, in duplicate, a concert: two marble-faced,</p>
<p>becalmed Frenchmen sitting side by side, with Monsieur H. H.&#x2019;s musical</p>
<p>little girl on her father&#x2019;s right, and the musical little boy of Professor</p>
<p>W. (father spending a hygienic evening in Providence) on Monsieur G. G.&#x2019;s</p>
<p>left. Opening the garage, a square of light that engulfs the car and is</p>
<p>extinguished. Brightly pajamaed, jerking down the window shade in Dolly&#x2019;s</p>
<p>bedroom. Saturday morning, unseen, solemnly weighing the winter-bleached</p>
<p>lassie in the bathroom. Seen and heard Sunday morning, no churchgoer after</p>
<p>all, saying don&#x2019;t be too late, to Dolly who is bound for the covered court.</p>
<p>Letting in a queerly observant schoolmate of Dolly&#x2019;s: &#x201C;First time I&#x2019;ve seen</p>
<p>a man wearing a smoking jacket, sir&#x2013;except in movies, of course.&#x201D;</p>
<p> 9</p>
<p> Her girlfriends, whom I looked forward to meet, proved on the whole</p>
<p>disappointing. There was Opal Something, and Linda Hall, and Avis Chapman,</p>
<p>and Eva Rosen, and Mona Dahl (save one, all these names are approximations,</p>
<p>of course). Opal was a bashful, formless, bespectacled, bepimpled creature</p>
<p>who doted on Dolly who bullied her. With Linda Hall the school tennis</p>
<p>champion, Dolly played singles at least twice a week: I suspect Linda was a</p>
<p>true nymphet, but for some unknown reason she did not come&#x2013;was perhaps not</p>
<p>allowed to come&#x2013;to our house; so I recall her only as a flash of natural</p>
<p>sunshine on an indoor court. Of the rest, none had any claims to nymphetry</p>
<p>except Eva Rosen. Avis ws a plump lateral child with hairy legs, while Mona,</p>
<p>though handsome in a coarse sensual way and only a year older than my aging</p>
<p>mistress, had obviously long ceased to be a nymphet, if she ever had been</p>
<p>one. Eva Rosen, a displaced little person from France, was on the other hand</p>
<p>a good example of a not strikingly beautiful child revealing to the</p>
<p>perspicacious amateur some of the basic elements of nymphet charm, such as a</p>
<p>perfect pubescent figure and lingering eyes and high cheekbones. Her glossy</p>
<p>copper hair had Lolita&#x2019;s silkiness, and the features of her delicate</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (135 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>milky-white face with pink lips and silverfish eyelashes were less foxy than</p>
<p>those of her likes&#x2013;the great clan of intra-racial redheads; nor did she</p>
<p>sport their green uniform but wore, as I remember her, a lot of black or</p>
<p>cherry dark&#x2013;a very smart black pullover, for instance, and high-heeled</p>
<p>black shoes, and garnet-red fingernail polish. I spoke French to her (much</p>
<p>to Lo&#x2019;s disgust). The child&#x2019;s tonalities were still admirably pure, but for</p>
<p>school words and play words she resorted to current American and then a</p>
<p>slight Brooklyn accent would crop up in her speech, which was amusing in a</p>
<p>little Parisian who went to a select New England school with phoney British</p>
<p>aspirations. Unfortunately, despite &#x201C;that French kid&#x2019;s uncle&#x201D; being &#x201C;a</p>
<p>millionaire,&#x201D; Lo dropped Eva for some reason before I had had time to enjoy</p>
<p>in my modest way her fragrant presence in the Humbert open house. The reader</p>
<p>knows what importance I attached to having a bevy of page girls, consolation</p>
<p>prize nymphets, around my Lolita. For a while, I endeavored to interest my</p>
<p>senses in Mona Dahl who was a good deal around, especially during the spring</p>
<p>term when Lo and she got so enthusiastic about dramatics. I have often</p>
<p>wondered what secrets outrageously treacherous Dolores Haze had imparted to</p>
<p>Mona while blurting out to me by urgent and well-paid request various really</p>
<p>incredible details concerning an affair that Mona had had with a marine at</p>
<p>the seaside. It was characteristic of Lo that she chose for her closest chum</p>
<p>that elegant, cold, lascivious, experienced young female whom I once heard</p>
<p>(misheard, Lo swore) cheerfully say in the hallway to Lo&#x2013;who had remarked</p>
<p>that her (Lo&#x2019;s) sweater was of virgin wool: &#x201C;The only thing about you that</p>
<p>is, kiddo . . .&#x201D; She had a curiously husky voice, artificially waved dull</p>
<p>dark hair, earrings, amber-brown prominent eyes and luscious lips. Lo said</p>
<p>teachers had remonstrated with her on her loading herself with so much</p>
<p>costume jewelry. Her hands trembled. She was burdened with a 150 I.Q. And I</p>
<p>also knew she had a tremendous chocolate-brown mole on he womanish back</p>
<p>which I inspected the night Lo and she had worn low-cut pastel-colored,</p>
<p>vaporous dresses for a dance at the Butler Academy.</p>
<p> I am anticipating a little, but I cannot help running my memory all</p>
<p>over the keyboard of that school year. In the meeting my attempts to find</p>
<p>out what kind of boys Lo knew, Miss Dahl was elegantly evasive. Lo who had</p>
<p>gone to play tennis at Linda&#x2019;s country club had telephoned she might be a</p>
<p>full half hour late, and so, would I entertain Mona who was coming to</p>
<p>practice with her a scene from The Taming of the Shrew. Using all the</p>
<p>modulations, all the allure of manner and voice she was capable of and</p>
<p>staring at me with perhaps&#x2013;could I be mistaken?&#x2013;a faint gleam of</p>
<p>crystalline irony, beautiful Mona replied: &#x201C;Well, sir, the fact is Dolly is</p>
<p>not much concerned with mere boys. Fact is, we are rivals. She and I have a</p>
<p>crush on the Reverend Rigger.&#x201D; (This was a joke&#x2013;I have already mentioned</p>
<p>that gloomy giant of a man, with the jaw of a horse: he was to bore me to</p>
<p>near murder with his impressions of Switzerland at a tea party for parents</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (136 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>that I am unable to place correctly in terms of time.)</p>
<p> How had the ball been? Oh, it had been a riot. A what? A panic.</p>
<p>Terrific, in a word. Had Lo danced a lot? Oh, not a frightful lot, just as</p>
<p>much as she could stand. What did she, languorous Mona, think of Lo? Sir?</p>
<p>Did she think Lo was doing well at school? Gosh, she certainly was quite a</p>
<p>kid. But her general behavior was&#x2013;? Oh, she was a swell kid. But still?</p>
<p>&#x201C;Oh, she&#x2019;s a doll,&#x201D; concluded Mona, and sighed abruptly, and picked up a</p>
<p>book that happened to lie at hand, and with a change of expression, falsely</p>
<p>furrowing her brow, inquired: &#x201C;Do tell me about Ball Zack, sir. Is he really</p>
<p>that good?&#x201D; She moved up so close to my chair that I made out through</p>
<p>lotions and creams her uninteresting skin scent. A sudden odd thought</p>
<p>stabbed me: was my Lo playing the pimp? If so, she had found the wrong</p>
<p>substitute. Avoiding Mona&#x2019;&#x2019; cool gaze, I talked literature for a minute.</p>
<p>Then Dolly arrived&#x2013;and slit her pale eyes at us. I left the two friends to</p>
<p>their own devices. One of the latticed squares in a small cobwebby casement</p>
<p>window at the turn of the staircase was glazed with ruby, and that raw wound</p>
<p>among the unstained rectangles and its asymmetrical position&#x2013;a night&#x2019;s move</p>
<p>from the top&#x2013;always strangely disturbed me.</p>
<p> 10</p>
<p> Sometimes . . . Come on, how often exactly, Bert? Can you recall four,</p>
<p>five, more such occasions? Or would no human heart have survived two or</p>
<p>three? Sometimes (I have nothing to say in reply to your question), while</p>
<p>Lolita would be haphazardly preparing her homework, sucking a pencil,</p>
<p>lolling sideways in an easy chair with both legs over its arm, I would shed</p>
<p>all my pedagogic restraint, dismiss all our quarrels, forget all my</p>
<p>masculine pride&#x2013;and literally crawl on my knees to your chair, my Lolita!</p>
<p>You would give me one look&#x2013;a gray furry question mark of a look: &#x201C;Oh no,</p>
<p>not again&#x201D; (incredulity, exasperation); for you never deigned to believe</p>
<p>that I could, without any specific designs, ever crave to bury my face in</p>
<p>your plaid skirt, my darling! The fragility of those bare arms of yours&#x2013;how</p>
<p>I longed to enfold them, all your four limpid lovely limbs, a folded colt,</p>
<p>and take your head between my unworthy hands, and pull the temple-skin back</p>
<p>on both sides, and kiss your chinesed eyes, and&#x2013;&#x201D;Pulease, leave me alone,</p>
<p>will you,&#x201D; you would say, &#x201C;for Christ&#x2019;s sake leave me alone.&#x201D; And I would</p>
<p>get up from the floor while you looked on, your face deliberately twitching</p>
<p>in imitation of my tic nerveux. But never mind, never mind, I am only</p>
<p>a brute, never mind, let us go on with my miserable story.</p>

<p> One Monday forenoon, in December I think, Pratt asked me to come over</p>
<p>for a talk. Dolly&#x2019;s last report had been poor, I knew. But instead of</p>
<p>contenting myself with some such plausible explanation of this summons, I</p>
<p>imagined all sort of horrors, and had to fortify myself with a pint of my</p>
<p>&#x201C;pin&#x201D; before I could face the interview. Slowly, all Adam&#x2019;s apple and heart,</p>
<p>I went up the steps of the scaffold.</p>
<p> A huge woman, gray-haired, drowsy, with a broad flat nose and small</p>
<p>eyes behind black-rimmed glasses&#x2013;&#x201D;Sit down,&#x201D; she said, pointing to an</p>
<p>informal and humiliating hassock, while she perched with ponderous spryness</p>
<p>on the arm of an oak chair. For a moment or two, she peered at me with</p>
<p>smiling curiosity. She had done it at our first meeting, I recalled, but I</p>
<p>could afford then to scowl back. Her eye left me. She lapsed into</p>
<p>thought&#x2013;probably assumed. Making up her mind she rubbed, fold on fold, her</p>
<p>dark gray flannel skirt at the knee, dispelling a trace of chalk or</p>
<p>something. Then she said, still rubbing, not looking up:</p>
<p> &#x201C;Let me ask a blunt question, Mr. Haze. You are an old-fashioned</p>
<p>Continental father, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Why, no,&#x201D; I said, &#x201C;conservative, perhaps, but not what you would call</p>
<p>old-fashioned.&#x201D;</p>
<p> She sighed, frowned, then clapped her big plump hands together in a</p>
<p>let&#x2019;s-get-down-to-business manner, and again fixed her beady eyes upon me.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Dolly Haze,&#x201D; she said, &#x201C;is a lovely child, but the onset of sexual</p>
<p>maturing seems to give her trouble.&#x201D;</p>
<p> I bowed slightly. What else could I do?</p>
<p> &#x201C;She is still shuttling,&#x201D; said Miss Pratt, showing how with her</p>
<p>liver-spotted hands, &#x201C;between the anal and genital zones of development.</p>
<p>Basically she is a lovely&#x2013;&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;I beg your pardon,&#x201D; I said, &#x201C;what zones?&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;That&#x2019;s the old-fashioned European in you!&#x201D; cried Pratt delivering a</p>
<p>slight tap on my wrist watch and suddenly disclosing her dentures. &#x201C;All I</p>
<p>mean is that biologic drives&#x2013;do you smoke?&#x2013;are not fused in Dolly, do not</p>
<p>fall so to speak into a&#x2013;into a rounded pattern.&#x201D; Her hands held for a</p>
<p>moment an invisible melon.</p>
<p> &#x201C;She is attractive, bright though careless&#x201D; (breathing heavily, without</p>
<p>leaving her perch, the woman took time out to look at the lovely child&#x2019;s</p>
<p>report sheet on the desk at her right). &#x201C;Her marks are getting worse and</p>
<p>worse. Now I wonder, Mr. Haze&#x2013;&#x201D; Again the false meditation.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Well,&#x201D; she went on with zest, &#x201C;as for me, I do smoke, and, as dear Dr.</p>
<p>Pierce used to say: I&#x2019;m not proud of it but I jeest love it.&#x201D; She lit up and</p>
<p>the smoke she exhaled from her nostrils was like a pair of tusks.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Let me give you a few details, it won&#x2019;t take a moment. Now here let me</p>
<p>see [rummaging among her papers]. She is defiant toward Miss Redcock and</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (138 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>impossibly rude to Miss Cormorant. Now here is one of our special research</p>
<p>reports: Enjoys singing with group in class though mind seems to wander.</p>
<p>Crosses her knees and wags left leg to rhythm. Type of by-words: a</p>
<p>two-hundred-forty-two word area of the commonest pubescent slang fenced in</p>
<p>by a number of obviously European polysyllabics. Sighs a good deal in class.</p>
<p>Let me see. Yes. Now comes the last week in November. Sighs a good deal in</p>
<p>class. Chews gum vehemently. Does not bite her nails though if she did, this</p>
<p>would conform better to her general pattern&#x2013;scientifically speaking, of</p>
<p>course. Menstruation, according to the subject, well established. Belongs at</p>
<p>present to no church organization. By the way, Mr. Haze, her mother was&#x2013;?</p>
<p>Oh, I see. And you are&#x2013;? Nobody&#x2019;s business is, I suppose, God&#x2019;s business.</p>
<p>Something else we wanted to know. She was no regular home duties, I</p>
<p>understand. Making a princess of your Dolly, Mr. Haze, he? Well, what else</p>
<p>have we got here? Handles books gracefully. Voice pleasant. Giggles rather</p>
<p>often. A little dreamy. Has private jokes of her own, transposing for</p>
<p>instance the first letters of some of her teachers names. Hair light and</p>
<p>dark brown, lustrous&#x2013;well [laughing] you are aware of that, I</p>
<p>suppose. Nose unobstructed, feet high-arched, eyes-let me see, I had here</p>
<p>somewhere a still more recent report. Aha, here we are. Miss Gold says</p>
<p>Dolly&#x2019;s tennis form is excellent to superb, even better than Linda Hall&#x2019;s,</p>
<p>but concentration and point-accumulation are just &#x201C;poor to fair.&#x201D; Miss</p>
<p>Cormorant cannot decide whether Dolly has exceptional emotional control or</p>
<p>none at all. Miss Horn reports she&#x2013;I mean, Dolly&#x2013;cannot verbalize her</p>
<p>emotions, while according to Miss Cole Dolly&#x2019;s metabolic efficiency is</p>
<p>superfine. Miss Molar thinks Dolly is myopic and should see a good</p>
<p>ophthalmologist, but Miss Redcock insists that the girl simulates eye-strain</p>
<p>to get away with scholastic incompetence. And to conclude, Mr. Haze, our</p>
<p>researchers are wondering about something really crucial. Now I want to ask</p>
<p>you something. I want to know if your poor wife, or yourself, or anyone else</p>
<p>in the family&#x2013;I understand she has several aunts and a maternal grandfather</p>
<p>in California?&#x2013;oh, had!&#x2013;I&#x2019;m sorry&#x2013;well, we all wonder if anybody</p>
<p>in the family has instructed Dolly in the process of mammalian reproduction.</p>
<p>The general impression is that fifteen-year-old Dolly remains morbidly</p>
<p>uninterested in sexual matters, or to be exact, represses her curiosity in</p>
<p>order to save her ignorance and self-dignity. All right-fourteen. You see,</p>
<p>Mr. Haze, Beardsley School does not believe in bees and blossoms, and storks</p>
<p>and love birds, but it does believe very strongly in preparing its students</p>
<p>for mutually satisfactory mating and successful child rearing. We feel Dolly</p>
<p>could make excellent progress if only she would put her mind to her work.</p>
<p>Miss Cormorant&#x2019;s report is significant in that respect. Dolly is inclined to</p>
<p>be, mildly speaking impudent. But all feel that primo, you should</p>
<p>have your family doctor tell her the facts of life and, secundo, that</p>
<p>you allow her to enjoy the company of her schoolmates&#x2019; brothers at the</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (139 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>Junior Club or in Dr. Rigger&#x2019;s organization, or in the lovely homes of our</p>
<p>parents.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;She may meet boys at her own lovely home,&#x201D; I said.</p>
<p> &#x201C;I hope she will,&#x201D; said Pratt buoyantly. &#x201C;When we questioned her about</p>
<p>her troubles, Dolly refused to discuss the home situation, but we have</p>
<p>spoken to some of her friends and really&#x2013;well, for example, we insist you</p>
<p>un-veto her nonparticiaption in the dramatic group. You just must allow her</p>
<p>to take part in The Hunted Enchanters. She was such a perfect little</p>
<p>nymph in the try-out, and sometime in spring the author will stay for a few</p>
<p>days at Beardsley College and may attend a rehearsal or two in our new</p>
<p>auditorium. I mean it is all part of the fun of being young and alive and</p>
<p>beautiful. You must understand&#x2013;&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;I always thought of myself,&#x201D; I said, &#x201C;as a very understanding father.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Oh, no doubt, no doubt, but Miss Cormorant thinks, and I am inclined</p>
<p>to agree with her, that Dolly is obsessed by sexual thoughts for which she</p>
<p>finds no outlet, and will tease and martyrize other girls, or even our</p>
<p>younger instructors because they do have innocent dates with boys.&#x201D;</p>
<p> Shrugged my shoulders. A shabby &#xE8;migr&#xE8;.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Let us put our two heads together, Mr. Haze. What on earth is wrong</p>
<p>with that child?&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;She seems quite normal and happy to me,&#x201D; I said (disaster coming at</p>
<p>last? Was I found out? Had they got some hypnotist?).</p>
<p> &#x201C;What worries me,&#x201D; said Miss Pratt looking at her watch and starting to</p>
<p>go over the whole subject again, &#x201C;is that both teachers and schoolmates find</p>
<p>Dolly antagonistic, dissatisfied, cagey&#x2013;and everybody wonders why you are</p>
<p>so firmly opposed to all the natural recreations of a normal child.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Do you mean sex play?&#x201D; I asked jauntily, in despair, a cornered old</p>
<p>rat.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Well, I certainly welcome this civilized terminology,&#x201D; said Pratt with</p>
<p>a grin. &#x201C;But this is not quite the point. Under the auspices of Beardsley</p>
<p>School, dramatics, dances and other natural activities are not technically</p>
<p>sex play, though girls do meet boys, if that is what you object to.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;All right,&#x201D; I said, my hassock exhaling a weary sign. &#x201C;You win. She</p>
<p>can take part in that play. Provided male parts are taken by female parts.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;I am always fascinated,&#x201D; said Pratt, &#x201C;by the admirable way</p>
<p>foreigners&#x2013;or at least naturalized Americans&#x2013;use our rich language. I&#x2019;m</p>
<p>sure Miss Gold, who conducts the play group, will be overjoyed. I notice she</p>
<p>is one of the few teachers that seem to like&#x2013;I mean who seem to find Dolly</p>
<p>manageable. This takes care of general topics, I guess; now comes a special</p>
<p>matter. We are in trouble again.&#x201D;</p>
<p> Pratt paused truculently, then rubbed her index finger under her</p>
<p>nostrils with such vigor that her nose performed a kind of war dance.</p>
<p> &#x201C;I&#x2019;m a frank person,&#x201D; she said, &#x201C;but conventions are conventions, and I</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (140 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>find it difficult . . . Let me put it this way . . . The Walkers, who live</p>
<p>in what we call around here the Duke&#x2019;s Manor, you know the great gray house</p>
<p>on the hill&#x2013;they send their two girls to our school, and we have the niece</p>
<p>of President Moore with us, a really gracious child, not to speak of a</p>
<p>number of other prominent children. Well, under the circumstances, it is</p>
<p>rather a jolt when Dolly, who looks like a little lady, uses words which you</p>
<p>as a foreigner probably simply do not know or do not understand. Perhaps it</p>
<p>might be better&#x2013;Would you like me to have Dolly come up here right away to</p>
<p>discuss things? No? You see&#x2013;oh well, let&#x2019;s have it out. Dolly has written a</p>
<p>most obscene four-letter word which our Dr. Cutler tells me is low-Mexican</p>
<p>for urinal with her lipstick on some health pamphlets which Miss Redcock,</p>
<p>who is getting married in June, distributed among the girls, and we thought</p>
<p>she should stay after hours&#x2013;another half hour at least. But if you like&#x2013;&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;No,&#x201D; I said, &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t want to interfere with rules. I shall talk to</p>
<p>her later. I shall thrash it out.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Do,&#x201D; said the woman rising from her chair arm. &#x201C;And perhaps we can get</p>
<p>together again soon, and if things do not improve we might have Dr. Cutler</p>
<p>analyze her.&#x201D;</p>
<p> Should I marry Pratt and strangle her?</p>
<p> &#x201C;. . .And perhaps your family doctor might like to examine her</p>
<p>physically&#x2013;just a routine check-up. She is in Mushroom&#x2013;the last classroom</p>
<p>along that passage.&#x201D;</p>
<p> Beardsley School, it may be explained, copied a famous girls school in</p>
<p>England by having &#x201C;traditional&#x201D; nicknames for its various classrooms:</p>
<p>Mushroom, Room-In 8, B-Room, Room-BA and so on. Mushroom was smelly, with a</p>
<p>sepia print of Reynolds&#x2019; &#x201C;Age of Innocence&#x201D; above the chalkboard, and</p>
<p>several rows of clumsy-looking pupil desks. At one of these, my Lolita was</p>
<p>reading the chapter on &#x201C;Dialogue&#x201D; in Baker&#x2019;s Dramatic Technique, and</p>
<p>all was very quiet, and there was another girl with a very naked,</p>
<p>porcelain-white neck and wonderful platinum hair, who sat in front reading</p>
<p>too, absolutely lost to the world and interminably winding a soft curl</p>
<p>around one finger, and I sat beside Dolly just behind that neck and that</p>
<p>hair, and unbuttoned my overcoat and for sixty-five cents plus the</p>
<p>permission to participate in the school play, had Dolly put her inky,</p>
<p>chalky, red-knuckled hand under the desk. Oh, stupid and reckless of me, no</p>
<p>doubt, but after the torture I had been subjected to, I simply had to take</p>
<p>advantage of a combination that I knew would never occur again.</p>
<p> 12</p>
<p> Around Christmas she caught a bad chill and was examined by a friend of</p>
<p>Miss Lester, a Dr. Ilse Tristramson (hi, Ilse, you were a dear,</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (141 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>uninquisitive soul, and you touched my dove very gently). She diagnosed</p>
<p>bronchitis, patted Lo on the back (all its bloom erect because of the fever)</p>
<p>and put her to bed for a week or longer. At first she &#x201C;ran a temperature&#x201D; in</p>
<p>American parlance, and I could not resist the exquisite caloricity of</p>
<p>unexpected delights&#x2013;Venus febriculosa&#x2013;though it was a very languid Lolita</p>
<p>that moaned and coughed and shivered in my embrace. And as soon as she was</p>
<p>well again, I threw a Party with Boys.</p>
<p> Perhaps I had drunk a little too much in preparation for the ordeal.</p>
<p>Perhaps I made a fool of myself. The girls had decorated and plugged in a</p>
<p>small fir tree&#x2013;German custom, except that colored bulbs had superseded wax</p>
<p>candles. Records were chosen and fed into my landlord&#x2019;s phonograph. Chic</p>
<p>Dolly wore a nice gray dress with fitted bodice and flared skirt. Humming, I</p>
<p>retired to my study upstairs&#x2013;and then every ten or twenty minutes I would</p>
<p>come down like an idiot just for a few seconds; to pick up ostensibly my</p>
<p>pipe from the mantelpiece or hunt for the newspaper; and with every new</p>
<p>visit these simple actions became harder to perform, and I was reminded of</p>
<p>the dreadfully distant days when I used to brace myself to casually enter a</p>
<p>room in the Ramsdale house where Little Carmen was on.</p>
<p> The party was not a success. Of the three girls invited, one did not</p>
<p>come at all, and one of the boys brought his cousin Roy, so there was a</p>
<p>superfluity of two boys, and the cousins knew all the steps, and the other</p>
<p>fellows could hardly dance at all, and most of the evening was spent in</p>
<p>messing up the kitchen, and then endlessly jabbering about what card game to</p>
<p>play, and sometime later, two girls and four boys sat on the floor of the</p>
<p>living room, with all windows open, and played a word game which Opal could</p>
<p>not be made to understand, while Mona and Roy, a lean handsome lad, drank</p>
<p>ginger ale in the kitchen, sitting on the table and dangling their legs, and</p>
<p>hotly discussing Predestination and the Law of Averages. After they had all</p>
<p>gone my Lo said ugh, closed her eyes, and dropped into a chair with all four</p>
<p>limbs starfished to express the utmost disgust and exhaustion and swore it</p>
<p>was the most revolting bunch of boys she had ever seen. I bought her a new</p>
<p>tennis racket for that remark.</p>
<p> January was humid and warm, and February fooled the forsythia: none of</p>
<p>the townspeople had ever seen such weather. Other presents came</p>
<p>tumbling in. For her birthday I bought her a bicycle, the doe-like and</p>
<p>altogether charming machine already mentioned&#x2013;and added to this a</p>
<p>History of Modern American Painting: her bicycle manner, I mean her</p>
<p>approach to it, the hip movement in mounting, the grace and so on, afforded</p>
<p>me supreme pleasure; but my attempt to refine her pictorial taste was a</p>
<p>failure; she wanted to know if the guy noon-napping on Doris Lee&#x2019;s hay was</p>
<p>the father of the pseudo-voluptuous hoyden in the foreground, and could not</p>
<p>understand why I said Grant Wood or Peter Hurd was good, and Reginald Marsh</p>
<p>or Frederick Waugh awful.</p>

<p> 13</p>
<p> By the time spring had touched up Thayer Street with yellow and green</p>
<p>and pink, Lolita was irrevocably stage-struck. Pratt, whom I chanced to</p>
<p>notice one Sunday lunching with some people at Walton Inn, caught my eye</p>
<p>from afar and went through the motion of sympathetically and discreetly</p>
<p>clapping her hands while Lo was not looking. I detest the theatre as being a</p>
<p>primitive and putrid form, historically speaking; a form that smacks of</p>
<p>stone-age rites and communal nonsense despite those individual injections of</p>
<p>genius, such as, say, Elizabethan poetry which a closeted reader</p>
<p>automatically pumps out of the stuff. Being much occupied at the time with</p>
<p>my own literary labors, I did not bother to read the complete text of The</p>
<p>Enchanted Hunters, the playlet in which Dolores Haze was assigned the</p>
<p>part of a farmer&#x2019;s daughter who imagines herself to be a woodland witch, or</p>
<p>Diana, or something, and who, having got hold of a book on hypnotism,</p>
<p>plunges a number of lost hunters into various entertaining trances before</p>
<p>falling in her turn under the spell of a vagabond poet (Mona Dahl). That</p>
<p>much I gleaned from bits of crumpled and poorly typed script that Lo sowed</p>
<p>all over the house. The coincidence of the title with the name of an</p>
<p>unforgettable inn was pleasant in a sad little way: I wearily thought I had</p>
<p>better not bring it to my own enchantress&#x2019;s notice, lest a brazen accusation</p>
<p>of mawkishness hurt me even more than her failure to notice it for herself</p>
<p>had done. I assumed the playlet was just another, practically anonymous,</p>
<p>version of some banal legend. Nothing prevented one, of course, from</p>
<p>supposing that in quest of an attractive name the founder of the hotel had</p>
<p>been immediately and solely influenced by the chance fantasy of the</p>
<p>second-rate muralist he had hired, and that subsequently the hotel&#x2019;s name</p>
<p>had suggested the play&#x2019;s title. But in my credulous, simple, benevolent mind</p>
<p>I happened to twist it the other way round, and without giving the whole</p>
<p>matter much though really, supposed that mural, name and title had all been</p>
<p>derived from a common source, from some local tradition, which I, an alien</p>
<p>unversed in New England lore, would not be supposed to know. In consequence</p>
<p>I was under the impression (all this quite casually, you understand, quite</p>
<p>outside my orbit of importance) that the accursed playlet belonged to the</p>
<p>type of whimsy for juvenile consumption, arranged and rearranged many times,</p>
<p>such as Hansel and Gretel by Richard Roe, or The Sleeping</p>
<p>Beauty by Dorothy Doe, or The Emperor&#x2019;s New Clothes by Maurice</p>
<p>Vermont and Marion Rumpelmeyer&#x2013;all this to be found in any Plays for</p>
<p>School Actors or Let&#x2019;s Have a Play! In other words, I did not</p>
<p>know&#x2013;and would not have cared, if I did &#x2013;that actually The Enchanted</p>
<p>Hunters was a quite recent and technically original composition which</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (143 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>had been produced for the first time only three or four months ago by a</p>
<p>highbrow group in New York. To me&#x2013;inasmuch as I could judge from my</p>
<p>charmer&#x2019;s part&#x2013;it seemed to be a pretty dismal kind of fancy work, with</p>
<p>echoes from Lenormand and Maeterlinck and various quiet British dreamers.</p>
<p>The red-capped, uniformly attired hunters, of which one was a banker,</p>
<p>another a plumber, a third a policeman, a fourth an undertaker, a fifth an</p>
<p>underwriter, a sixth an escaped convict (you see the possibilities!), went</p>
<p>through a complete change of mind in Dolly&#x2019;s Dell, and remembered their real</p>
<p>lives only as dreams or nightmares from which little Diana had aroused them;</p>
<p>but a seventh Hunter (in a green cap, the fool) was a Young Poet, and</p>
<p>he insisted, much to Diana&#x2019;s annoyance, that she and the entertainment</p>
<p>provided (dancing nymphs, and elves, and monsters) were his, the Poet&#x2019;s,</p>
<p>invention. I understand that finally, in utter disgust at his cocksureness,</p>
<p>barefooted Dolores was to lead check-trousered Mona to the paternal farm</p>
<p>behind the Perilous Forest to prove to the braggart she was not a poet&#x2019;s</p>
<p>fancy, but a rustic, down-to-brown-earth lass&#x2013;and a last-minute kiss was to</p>
<p>enforce the play&#x2019;s profound message, namely, that mirage and reality merge</p>
<p>in love. I considered it wiser not to criticize the thing in front of Lo:</p>
<p>she was so healthily engrossed in &#x201C;problems of expression,&#x201D; and so</p>
<p>charmingly did she put her narrow Florentine hands together, batting her</p>
<p>eyelashes and pleading with me not to come to rehearsals as some ridiculous</p>
<p>parents did because she wanted to dazzle me with a perfect First Night&#x2013;and</p>
<p>because I was, anyway, always butting in and saying the wrong thing, and</p>
<p>cramping her style in the presence of other people.</p>
<p> There was one very special rehearsal . . . my heart, my heart . . .</p>
<p>there was one day in May marked by a lot of gay flurry&#x2013;it all rolled past,</p>
<p>beyond my ken, immune to my memory, and when I saw Lo next, in the late</p>
<p>afternoon, balancing on her bike, pressing the palm of her hand to the damp</p>
<p>bark of a young birch tree on the edge of our lawn, I was so struck by the</p>
<p>radiant tenderness of her smile that for an instant I believed all our</p>
<p>troubles gone. &#x201C;Can you remember,&#x201D; she said, &#x201C;what was the name of that</p>
<p>hotel, you know [nose pucketed], come on, you know&#x2013;with those white</p>
<p>columns and the marble swan in the lobby? Oh, you know [noisy exhalation of</p>
<p>breath]&#x2013;the hotel where you raped me. Okay, skip it. I mean, was it [almost</p>
<p>in a whisper] The Enchanted Hunters? Oh, it was? [musingly] Was it?&#x201D;&#x2013;and</p>
<p>with a yelp of amorous vernal laughter she slapped the glossy bole and tore</p>
<p>uphill, to the end of the street, and then rode back, feet at rest on</p>
<p>stopped pedals, posture relaxed, one hand dreaming in her print-flowered</p>
<p>lap.</p>

<p> Because it supposedly tied up with her interest in dance and dramatics,</p>
<p>I had permitted Lo to take piano lessons with a Miss Emperor (as we French</p>
<p>scholars may conveniently call her) to whose blue-shuttered little white</p>
<p>house a mile or so beyond Beardsley Lo would spin off twice a week. One</p>
<p>Friday night toward the end of May (and a week or so after the very special</p>
<p>rehearsal Lo had not had me attend) the telephone in my study, where I was</p>
<p>in the act of mopping up Gustave&#x2019;s&#x2013;I mean Gaston&#x2019;s&#x2013;king&#x2019;s side, rang and</p>
<p>Miss Emperor asked if Lo was coming next Tuesday because she had missed last</p>
<p>Tuesday&#x2019;s and today&#x2019;s lessons. I said she would by all means&#x2013;and went on</p>
<p>with the game. As the reader may well imagine, my faculties were now</p>
<p>impaired, and a move or two later, with Gaston to play, I noticed through</p>
<p>the film of my general distress that he could collect my queen; he noticed</p>
<p>it too, but thinking it might be a trap on the part of his tricky opponent,</p>
<p>he demurred for quite a minute, and puffed and wheezed, and shook his jowls,</p>
<p>and even shot furtive glances at me, and made hesitating half-thrusts with</p>
<p>his pudgily bunched fingers&#x2013;dying to take that juicy queen and not</p>
<p>daring&#x2013;and all of a sudden he swooped down upon it (who knows if it did not</p>
<p>teach him certain later audacities?), and I spent a dreary hour in achieving</p>
<p>a draw. He finished his brandy and presently lumbered away, quite satisfied</p>
<p>with this result (mon pauvre ami, je ne vous ai jamais revu et quoiqu&#x2019;il</p>
<p>y ait bien peu de chance que vous voyiez mon livre, permiettez-moi de vous</p>
<p>dire que je vous serre la main bien cordialement, et que toutes mes</p>
<p>fillettes vous saluent). I found Dolores Haze at the kitchen table,</p>
<p>consuming a wedge of pie, with her eyes fixed on her script. They rose to</p>
<p>meet mine with a kind of celestial vapidity. She remained singularly</p>
<p>unruffled when confronted with my discovery, and said d&#x2019;un petit air</p>
<p>faussement contrit that she knew she was a very wicked kid, but simply</p>
<p>had not been able to resist the enchantment, and had used up those music</p>
<p>hours&#x2013;O Reader, My Reader!&#x2013;in a nearby public park rehearsing the magic</p>
<p>forest scene with Mona. I said &#x201C;fine&#x201D;&#x2013;and stalked to the telephone. Mona&#x2019;s</p>
<p>mother answered: &#x201C;Oh yes, she&#x2019;s in&#x201D; and retreated with a mother&#x2019;s neutral</p>
<p>laugh of polite pleasure to shout off stage &#x201C;Roy calling!&#x201D; and the very next</p>
<p>moment Mona rustled up, and forthwith, in a low monotonous not untender</p>
<p>voice started berating Roy for something he had said or done and I</p>
<p>interrupted her, and presently Mona was saying in her humbles, sexiest</p>
<p>contralto, &#x201C;yes, sir,&#x201D; &#x201C;surely, sir&#x201D; &#x201C;I am alone to blame, sir, in this</p>
<p>unfortunate business,&#x201D; (what elocution! what poise!) &#x201C;honest, I feel very</p>
<p>bad about it&#x201D;&#x2013;and so on and so forth as those little harlots say.</p>
<p> So downstairs I went clearing my throat and holding my heart. Lo was</p>
<p>now in the living room, in her favorite overstuffed chair. As she sprawled</p>
<p>there, biting at a hangnail an mocking me with her heartless vaporous eyes,</p>
<p>and all the time rocking a stool upon which she had placed the heel of an</p>
<p>outstretched shoeless foot, I perceived all at once with a sickening qualm</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (145 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>how much she had changed since I first met her two years ago. Or had this</p>
<p>happened during those last two weeks? Tendresse? Surely that was an</p>
<p>exploded myth. She sat right in the focus of my incandescent anger. The fog</p>
<p>of all lust had been swept away leaving nothing but this dreadful lucidity.</p>
<p>Oh, she had changed! Her complexion was now that of any vulgar untidy</p>
<p>highschool girl who applies shared cosmetics with grubby fingers to an</p>
<p>unwashed face and does not mind what soiled texture, what pustulate</p>
<p>epidermis comes in contact with her skin. Its smooth tender bloom had been</p>
<p>so lovely in former days, so bright with tears, when I used to roll, in</p>
<p>play, her tousled head on my knee. A coarse flush had now replaced that</p>
<p>innocent fluorescence. What was locally known as a &#x201C;rabbit cold&#x201D; had painted</p>
<p>with flaming pink the edges of her contemptuous nostrils. As in terror I</p>
<p>lowered my gaze, it mechanically slid along the underside of her tensely</p>
<p>stretched bare thigh&#x2013;how polished and muscular her legs had grown! She kept</p>
<p>her wide-set eyes, clouded-glass gray and slightly bloodshot, fixed upon me,</p>
<p>and I saw the stealthy thought showing through them that perhaps after all</p>
<p>Mona was right, and she, orphan Lo, could expose me without getting</p>
<p>penalized herself. How wrong I was. How mad I was! Everything about her was</p>
<p>of the same exasperating impenetrable order&#x2013;the strength of her shapely</p>
<p>legs, the dirty sole of her white sock, the thick sweater she wore despite</p>
<p>the closeness of the room, her wenchy smell, and especially the dead end of</p>
<p>her face with its strange flush and freshly made-up lips. Some of the red</p>
<p>had left stains on her front teeth, and I was struck by a ghastly</p>
<p>recollection&#x2013;the evoked image not of Monique, but of another young</p>
<p>prostitute in a bell-house, ages ago, who had been snapped up by somebody</p>
<p>else before I had time to decide whether her mere youth warranted my risking</p>
<p>some appalling disease, and who had just such flushed prominent</p>
<p>pommettes and a dead maman, and big front teeth, and a bit of</p>
<p>dingy red ribbon in her country-brown hair.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Well, speak,&#x201D; said Lo. &#x201C;Was the corroboration satisfactory?&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Oh, yes,&#x201D; I said. &#x201C;Perfect. yes. And I do not doubt you two made it</p>
<p>up. As a matter of fact, I do not doubt you have told her everything about</p>
<p>us.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Oh, yeah?&#x201D;</p>
<p> I controlled my breath and said: &#x201C;Dolores, this must stop right away. I</p>
<p>am ready to yank you out of Beardsley and lock you up you know where, but</p>
<p>this must stop. I am ready to take you away the time it takes to pack a</p>
<p>suitcase. This must stop or else anything may happen.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Anything may happen, huh?&#x201D;</p>
<p> I snatched away the stool she was rocking with her heel and her foot</p>
<p>fell with a thud on the floor.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Hey,&#x201D; she cried, &#x201C;take it easy.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;First of all you go upstairs,&#x201D; I cried in my turn,&#x2013;and simultaneously</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (146 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>grabbed at her and pulled her up. From that moment, I stopped restraining my</p>
<p>voice, and we continued yelling at each other, and she said, unprintable</p>
<p>things. She said she loathed me. She made monstrous faces at me, inflating</p>
<p>her cheeks and producing a diabolical plopping sound. She said I had</p>
<p>attempted to violate her several times when I was her mother&#x2019;s roomer. She</p>
<p>said she was sure I had murdered her mother. She said she would sleep with</p>
<p>the very first fellow who asked her and I could do nothing about it. I said</p>
<p>she was to go upstairs and show me all her hiding places. It was a strident</p>
<p>and hateful scene. I held her by her knobby wrist and she kept turning and</p>
<p>twisting it this way and that, surreptitiously trying to find a weak point</p>
<p>so as to wrench herself free at a favorable moment, but I held her quite</p>
<p>hard and in fact hurt her rather badly for which I hope my heart may rot,</p>
<p>and once or twice she jerked her arm so violently that I feared her wrist</p>
<p>might snap, and all the while she stared at me with those unforgettable eyes</p>
<p>where could anger and hot tears struggled, and our voices were drowning the</p>
<p>telephone, and when I grew aware of its ringing she instantly escaped.</p>
<p> With people in movies I seem to share the services of the machina</p>
<p>telephonica and its sudden god. This time it was an irate neighbor. The east</p>
<p>window happened to be agape in the living room, with the blind mercifully</p>
<p>down, however; and behind it the damp black night of a sour New England</p>
<p>spring had been breathlessly listening to us. I had always thought that type</p>
<p>of haddocky spinster with the obscene mind was the result of considerable</p>
<p>literary inbreeding in modern fiction; but now I am convinced that prude and</p>
<p>prurient Miss East&#x2013;or to explode her incognito, Miss Fenton Lebone&#x2013;had</p>
<p>been probably protruding three-quarter-way from her bedroom window as she</p>
<p>strove to catch the gist of our quarrel.</p>
<p> &#x201C;. . . This racket . . . lacks all sense of . . . &#x201C; quacked the</p>
<p>receiver, &#x201C;we do not live in a tenement here. I must emphatically . . . &#x201C;</p>
<p> I apologized for my daughter&#x2019;s friends being so loud. Young people, you</p>
<p>know&#x2013;and cradled the next quack and a half.</p>
<p> Downstairs the screen door banged. Lo? Escaped?</p>
<p> Through the casement on the stairs I saw a small impetuous ghost slip</p>
<p>through the shrubs; a silvery dot in the dark&#x2013;hub of the bicycle</p>
<p>wheel&#x2013;moved, shivered, and she was gone.</p>
<p> It so happened that the car was spending the night in a repair shop</p>
<p>downtown. I had no other alternative than to pursue on foot the winged</p>
<p>fugitive. Even now, after more than three years have heaved and elapsed, I</p>
<p>cannot visualize that spring-night street, that already so leafy street,</p>
<p>without a gasp of panic. Before their lighted porch Miss Lester was</p>
<p>promenading Miss Favian&#x2019;s dropsical dackel. Mr. Hyde almost knocked it over.</p>
<p>Walk three steps and runt three. A tepid rain started to drum on the</p>
<p>chestnut leaves. At the next corner, pressing Lolita against an iron</p>
<p>railing, a blurred youth held and kissed&#x2013;no, not her, mistake. My talons</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (147 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>still tingling, I flew on.</p>
<p> Half a mile or so east of number fourteen, Thayer Street tangles with a</p>
<p>private lane and a cross street; the latter leads to the town proper; in</p>
<p>front of the first drugstore, I saw&#x2013;with what melody of relief!&#x2013;Lolita&#x2019;s</p>
<p>fair bicycle waiting for her. I pushed instead of pulling, pulled, pushed,</p>
<p>pulled, and entered. Look out! some ten paces away Lolita, though the glass</p>
<p>of a telephone booth (membranous god still with us), cupping the tube,</p>
<p>confidentially hunched over it, slit her eyes at me, turned away with her</p>
<p>treasure, hurriedly hung up, and walked out with a flourish.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Tried to reach you at home,&#x201D; she said brightly. &#x201C;A great decision has</p>
<p>been made. But first buy me a drink, dad.&#x201D;</p>
<p> She watched the listless pale fountain girl put in the ice, pour in the</p>
<p>coke, add the cherry syrup&#x2013;and my heart was bursting with love-ache. That</p>
<p>childish wrist. My lovely child. You have a lovely child, Mr. Humbert. We</p>
<p>always admire her as she passes by. Mr. Pim watched Pippa suck in the</p>
<p>concoction.</p>
<p> J&#x2019;ai toujours admir&#xE8; l&#x2019;oeuvre du sublime dublinois. And in the</p>
<p>meantime the rain had become a voluptuous shower.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Look,&#x201D; she said as she rode the bike beside me, one foot scraping the</p>
<p>darkly glistening sidewalk, &#x201C;look, I&#x2019;ve decided something. I want to leave</p>
<p>school I hate that school I hate the play, I really do! Never go back. Find</p>
<p>another. Leave at once. Go for a long trip again. But this time we&#x2019;ll</p>
<p>go wherever I want, won&#x2019;t we?&#x201D;</p>
<p> I nodded. My Lolita.</p>
<p> &#x201C;I choose? C&#x2019;est entendu?&#x201D; she asked wobbling a little beside</p>
<p>me. Used French only when she was a very good little girl.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Okay. Entendu. Now hop-hop-hop, Lenore, or you&#x2019;ll get soaked.&#x201D;</p>
<p>(A storm of sobs was filling my chest.)</p>
<p> She bared her teeth and after her adorable school-girl fashioned,</p>
<p>leaned forward, and away she sped, my bird.</p>
<p> Miss Lester&#x2019;s finely groomed hand held a porch-door open for a waddling</p>
<p>old dog qui prenait son temps.</p>
<p> Lo was waiting for me near the ghostly birch tree.</p>
<p> &#x201C;I am drenched,&#x201D; she declared at the top of her voice. &#x201C;Are you glad?</p>
<p>To hell with the play! See what I mean?&#x201D;</p>
<p> An invisible hag&#x2019;s claw slammed down an upper-floor window.</p>
<p> In our hallway, ablaze with welcoming lights, my Lolita peeled off her</p>
<p>sweater, shook her gemmed hair, stretched towards me two bare arms, raised</p>
<p>one knee:</p>
<p> &#x201C;Carry me upstairs, please. I feel sort of romantic tonight.&#x201D;</p>
<p> It may interest physiologists to learn, at this point, that I have the</p>
<p>ability&#x2013;a most singular case, I presume&#x2013;of shedding torrents of tears</p>
<p>throughout the other tempest.</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (148 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p> 15</p>
<p> The brakes were relined, the waterpipes unclogged, the valves ground,</p>
<p>and a number of other repairs and improvements were paid for by not very</p>
<p>mechanically-minded but prudent papa Humbert, so that the late Mrs.</p>
<p>Humbert&#x2019;s car was in respectable shape when ready to undertake a new</p>
<p>journey.</p>
<p> We had promised Beardsley School, good old Beardsley School, that we</p>
<p>would be back as soon as my Hollywood engagement came to an end (inventive</p>
<p>Humbert was to be, I hinted, chief consultant in the production of a film</p>
<p>dealing with &#x201C;existentialism,&#x201D; still a hot thing at the time). Actually I</p>
<p>was toying with the idea of gently trickling across the Mexican border&#x2013;I</p>
<p>was braver now than last year&#x2013;and there deciding what to do with my little</p>
<p>concubine who was now sixty inches tall and weighed ninety pounds. We had</p>
<p>dug out our tour books and maps. She had traced our route with immense zest.</p>
<p>Was it thanks to those theatricals that she had now outgrown her juvenile</p>
<p>jaded airs and was so adorably keen to explore rich reality? I experienced</p>
<p>the queer lightness of dreams that pale but warm Sunday morning when we</p>
<p>abandoned Professor Chem&#x2019;s puzzled house and sped along Main Street toward</p>
<p>the four-lane highway. My Love&#x2019;s striped, black-and-white cotton frock,</p>
<p>jauntry blue with the large beautifully cut aquamarine on a silver chainlet,</p>
<p>which gemmed her throat: a spring rain gift from me. We passed the New</p>
<p>Hotel, and she laughed. &#x201C;A penny for your thoughts,&#x201D; I said and she</p>
<p>stretched out her palm at once, but at that moment I had to apply the breaks</p>
<p>rather abruptly at a red light. As we pulled up, another car came to a</p>
<p>gliding stop alongside, and a very striking looking, athletically lean young</p>
<p>woman (where had I seen her?) with a high complexion and shoulder-length</p>
<p>brilliant bronze hair, greeted Lo with a ringing &#x201C;Hi!&#x201D;&#x2013;and then, addressing</p>
<p>me, effusively, edusively (placed!), stressing certain words, said: &#x201C;What a</p>
<p>shame to was to tear Dolly away from the play&#x2013;you should have</p>
<p>heard the author raving about her after that rehearsal&#x2013;&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Green light, you dope,&#x201D; said Lo under her breath, and simultaneously,</p>
<p>waving in bright adieu a bangled arm, Joan of Arc (in a performance we saw</p>
<p>at the local theatre) violently outdistanced us to swerve into Campus</p>
<p>Avenue.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Who was it exactly? Vermont or Rumpelmeyer?&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;No&#x2013;Edusa Gold&#x2013;the gal who coaches us.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;I was not referring to her. Who exactly concocted that play?&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Oh! Yes, of course. Some old woman, Clare Something, I guess. There</p>
<p>was quite a crowd of them there.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;So she complimented you?&#x201D;</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (149 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p> &#x201C;Complimented my eye&#x2013;she kissed me on my pure brow&#x201D;&#x2013;and my darling</p>
<p>emitted that new yelp of merriment which&#x2013;perhaps in connection with her</p>
<p>theatrical mannerisms&#x2013;she had lately begun to affect.</p>
<p> &#x201C;You are a funny creature, Lolita,&#x201D; I said&#x2013;or some such words.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Naturally, I am overjoyed you gave up that absurd stage business. But what</p>
<p>is curious is that you dropped the whole thing only a week before its</p>
<p>natural climax. Oh, Lolita, you should be careful of those surrenders of</p>
<p>yours. I remember you gave up Ramsdale for camp, and camp for a joyride, and</p>
<p>I could list other abrupt changes in your disposition. You must be careful.</p>
<p>There are things that should never be given up. You must persevere. You</p>
<p>should try to be a little nicer to me, Lolita. You should also watch your</p>
<p>diet. The tour of your thigh, you know, should not exceed seventeen and a</p>
<p>half inches. More might be fatal (I was kidding, of course). We are now</p>
<p>setting out on a long happy journey. I remember&#x2013;&#x201D;</p>
<p> 16</p>
<p> I remember as a child in Europe gloating over a map of North America</p>
<p>that had &#x201C;Appalachian Mountains&#x201D; boldly running from Alabama up to New</p>
<p>Brunswick, so that the whole region they spanned&#x2013;Tennessee, the Virginias,</p>
<p>Pennsylvania, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine, appeared to my</p>
<p>imagination as a gigantic Switzerland or even Tibet, all mountain, glorious</p>
<p>diamond peak upon peak, giant conifers, le montagnard &#xE8;migr&#xE8; in his</p>
<p>bear skin glory, and Felis tigris goldsmithi, and Red Indians under</p>
<p>the catalpas. That it all boiled down to a measly suburban lawn and a</p>
<p>smoking garbage incinerator, was appalling. Farewell, Appalachia! Leaving</p>
<p>it, we crossed Ohio, the three states beginning with &#x201C;I,&#x201D; and Nebraska&#x2013;ah,</p>
<p>that first whiff of the West! We traveled very leisurely, having more than a</p>
<p>week to reach Wace, Continental Divide, where she passionately desired to</p>
<p>see he Ceremonial Dances marking the seasonal opening of Magic Cave, and at</p>
<p>least three weeks to reach Elphinstone, gem of a western State where she</p>
<p>yearned to climb Red Rock from which a mature screen star had recently</p>
<p>jumped to her death after a drunken row with her gigolo.</p>
<p> Again we were welcomed to wary motels by means of inscriptions that</p>
<p>read:</p>
<p> &#x201C;We wish you feel at home while here. All equipment was</p>
<p>carefully checked upon your arrival. Your license number is on record here.</p>
<p>Use hot water sparingly. We reserve the right to eject without notice any</p>
<p>objectionable person. Do not throw waste material of any kind in the</p>
<p>toilet bowl. Thank you. Call again. The Management. P.S. We consider our</p>
<p>guests the Finest People of the World.&#x201D;</p>
<p> In these frightening places we paid ten for twins, flies queued outside</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (150 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>at the screenless door and successfully scrambled in, the ashes of our</p>
<p>predecessors still lingered in the ashtrays, a woman&#x2019;s hair lay on the</p>
<p>pillow, one heard one&#x2019;s neighbor hanging his coat in his closet, the hangers</p>
<p>were ingeniously fixed to their bars by coils of wire so as to thwart theft,</p>
<p>and, in crowning insult, the pictures above the twin beds were identical</p>
<p>twins. I also noticed that commercial fashion was changing. There was a</p>
<p>tendency for cabins to fuse and gradually form the caravansary, and, lo (she</p>
<p>was not interested but the reader may be), a second story was added, and a</p>
<p>lobby grew in, and cars were removed to a communal garage, and the motel</p>
<p>reverted to the good old hotel.</p>
<p> I now warn the reader not to mock me and my mental daze. It is easy for</p>
<p>him and me to decipher now a past destiny; but a destiny in the</p>
<p>making is, believe me, not one of those honest mystery stories where all you</p>
<p>have to do is keep an eye on the clues. In my youth I once read a French</p>
<p>detective tale where the clues were actually in italics; but that is not</p>
<p>McFate&#x2019;s way&#x2013;even if one does learn to recognize certain obscure</p>
<p>indications.</p>
<p> For instance: I would not swear that there was not at least one</p>
<p>occasion, prior to, or at the very beginning of, the Midwest lap of our</p>
<p>journey, when she managed to convey some information to, or otherwise get</p>
<p>into contact with, a person or persons unknown. We had stopped at a gas</p>
<p>station, under the sign of Pegasus, and she had slipped out of her seat and</p>
<p>escaped to the rear of the premises while the raised hood, under which I had</p>
<p>bent to watch the mechanic&#x2019;s manipulations, hid her for a moment from my</p>
<p>sight. Being inclined to be lenient, I only shook my benign head though</p>
<p>strictly speaking such visits were taboo, since I felt instinctively that</p>
<p>toilets&#x2013;as also telephones&#x2013;happened to be, for reasons unfathomable, the</p>
<p>points where my destiny was liable to catch. We all have such fateful</p>
<p>objects&#x2013;it may be a recurrent landscape in one case, a number in</p>
<p>another&#x2013;carefully chosen by the gods to attract events of special</p>
<p>significance for us: here shall John always stumble; there shall Jane&#x2019;s</p>
<p>heart always break.</p>
<p> Well&#x2013;my car had been attended to, and I had moved it away from the</p>
<p>pumps to let a pickup truck be serviced&#x2013;when the growing volume of her</p>
<p>absence began to weigh upon me in the windy grayness. Not for the first</p>
<p>time, and not for the last, had I stared in such dull discomfort of mind at</p>
<p>those stationary trivialities that look almost surprised, like staring</p>
<p>rustics, to find themselves in the stranded traveler&#x2019;s field of vision: that</p>
<p>green garbage can, those very black, very whitewalled tires for sale, those</p>
<p>bright cans of motor oil, that red icebox with assorted drinks, the four,</p>
<p>five, seven discarded bottles within the incompleted crossword puzzle of</p>
<p>their wooden cells, that bug patiently walking up the inside of the window</p>
<p>of the office. Radio music was coming from its open door, and because the</p>

<p>rhythm was not synchronized with the heave and flutter and other gestures of</p>
<p>wind-animated vegetation, one had the impression of an old scenic film</p>
<p>living its own life while piano or fiddle followed a line of music quite</p>
<p>outside the shivering flower, the swaying branch. The sound of Charlotte&#x2019;s</p>
<p>last sob incongruously vibrated through me as, with her dress fluttering</p>
<p>athwart the rhythm, Lolita veered from a totally unexpected direction. She</p>
<p>had found the toilet occupied and had crossed over to the sign of the Conche</p>
<p>in the next block. They said there they were proud of their home-clean</p>
<p>restrooms. These prepaid postcards, they said, had been provided for your</p>
<p>comments. No postcards. No soap. Nothing. No comments.</p>
<p> That day or the next, after a tedious drive through a land of food</p>
<p>crops, we reached a pleasant little burg and put up at Chestnut Court&#x2013;nice</p>
<p>cabins, damp green grounds, apple trees, an old swing&#x2013;and a tremendous</p>
<p>sunset which the tried child ignored. She had wanted to go through Kasbeam</p>
<p>because it was only thirty miles north from her home town but on the</p>
<p>following morning I found her quite listless, with no desire to see again</p>
<p>the sidewalk where she had played hopscotch some five years before. For</p>
<p>obvious reasons I had rather dreaded that side trip, even though we had</p>
<p>agreed not to make ourselves conspicuous in any way&#x2013;to remain in the car</p>
<p>and not look up old friends. My relief at her abandoning the project was</p>
<p>spoiled by the thought that had she felt I were totally against the</p>
<p>nostalgic possibilities of Pisky, as I had been last year, she would not</p>
<p>have given up so easily. On my mentioning this with a sigh, she sighed too</p>
<p>and complained of being out of sorts. She wanted to remain in bed till</p>
<p>teatime at least, with lots of magazines, and then if she felt better she</p>
<p>suggested we just continue westward. I must say she was very sweet and</p>
<p>languid, and craved for fresh fruits, and I decided to go and fetch her a</p>
<p>toothsome picnic lunch in Kasbeam. Our cabin stood on the timbered crest of</p>
<p>a hill, and from our window you could see the road winding down, and then</p>
<p>running as straight as a hair parting between two rows of chestnut trees,</p>
<p>towards the pretty town, which looked singularly distinct and toylike in the</p>
<p>pure morning distance. One could make out an elf-like girl on an insect-like</p>
<p>bicycle, and a dog, a bit too large proportionately, all as clear as those</p>
<p>pilgrims and mules winding up wax-pale roads in old paintings with blue</p>
<p>hills and red little people. I have the European urge to use my feet when a</p>
<p>drive can be dispensed with, so I leisurely walked down, eventually meeting</p>
<p>the cyclist&#x2013;a plain plump girl with pigtails, followed by a huge St.</p>
<p>Bernard dog with orbits like pansies. In Kasbeam a very old barber gave me a</p>
<p>very mediocre haircut: he babbled of a baseball-playing son of his, and, at</p>
<p>every explodent, spat into my neck, and every now and then wiped his glasses</p>
<p>on my sheet-wrap, or interrupted his tremulous scissor work to produce faded</p>
<p>newspaper clippings, and so inattentive was I that it came as a shock to</p>
<p>realize as he pointed to an easeled photograph among the ancient gray</p>

<p>lotions, that the mustached young ball player had been dead for the last</p>
<p>thirty years.</p>
<p> I had a cup of hot flavorless coffee, bought a bunch of bananas for my</p>
<p>monkey, and spent another ten minutes or so in a delicatessen store. At</p>
<p>least an hour and a half must have elapsed when this homeward-bound little</p>
<p>pilgrim appeared on the winding road leading to Chestnut Castle.</p>
<p> The girl I had seen on my way to town was now loaded with linen and</p>
<p>engaged in helping a misshapen man whose big head and coarse features</p>
<p>reminded me of the &#x201C;Bertoldo&#x201D; character in low Italian comedy. They were</p>
<p>cleaning the cabins of which there was a dozen or so on Chestnut Crest, all</p>
<p>pleasantly spaced amid the copious verdure. It was noon, and most of them,</p>
<p>with a final bang of their screen doors, had already got rid of their</p>
<p>occupants. A very elderly, almost mummy-like couple in a very new model were</p>
<p>in the act of creeping out of one of the contiguous garages; from another a</p>
<p>red hood protruded in somewhat cod-piece fashion; and nearer to our cabin, a</p>
<p>strong and handsome young man with a shock of black hair and blue eyes was</p>
<p>putting a portable refrigerator into a station wagon. For some reason he</p>
<p>gave me a sheepish grin as I passed. On the grass expanse opposite, in the</p>
<p>many-limbed shade of luxuriant trees, the familiar St. Bernard dog was</p>
<p>guarding his mistress&#x2019; bicycle, and nearby a young woman, far gone in the</p>
<p>family way, had seated a rapt baby on a swing and was rocking it gently,</p>
<p>while a jealous boy of two or three was making a nuisance of himself by</p>
<p>trying to push or pull the swing board; he finally succeeded in getting</p>
<p>himself knocked down by it, and bawled loudly as he lay supine on the grass</p>
<p>while his mother continued to smile gently at neither of her present</p>
<p>children. I recall so clearly these minutiae probably because I was to</p>
<p>check my impressions so thoroughly only a few minutes later; and besides,</p>
<p>something in me had been on guard ever since that awful night in Beardsley.</p>
<p>I now refused to be diverted by the feeling of well-being that my walk had</p>
<p>engendered&#x2013;by the young summer breeze that enveloped the nape of my neck,</p>
<p>the giving crunch of the damn gravel, the juice tidbit. I had sucked out at</p>
<p>last from a hollowy tooth, and even the comfortable weight of my provisions</p>
<p>which the general condition of my heart should not have allowed me to carry;</p>
<p>but even that miserable pump of mine seemed to be working sweetly, and I</p>
<p>felt adolori d&#x2019;amoureuse langueur, to quote dear old Ronsard, as I</p>
<p>reached the cottage where I had left my Dolores.</p>
<p> To my surprise I found her dressed. She was sitting on the edge of the</p>
<p>bed in slacks and T-shirt, and was looking at me as if she could not quite</p>
<p>place me. The frank soft shape of her small breasts was brought out rather</p>
<p>than blurred by the limpness of her thin shirt, and this frankness irritated</p>
<p>me. She had not washed; yet her mouth was freshly though smudgily painted,</p>
<p>and her broad teeth glistened like wine-tinged ivory, or pinkish poker</p>
<p>chips. And there she sat, hands clasped in her lap, and dreamily brimmed</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (153 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>with a diabolical glow that had no relations to me whatever.</p>
<p> I plumped down my heavy paper bag and stood staring at the bare ankles</p>
<p>of her sandaled feet, then at her silly face, then again at her sinful feet.</p>
<p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;ve been out,&#x201D; I said (the sandals were filthy with gravel).</p>
<p> &#x201C;I just got up,&#x201D; she replied, and added upon intercepting my downward</p>
<p>glance: &#x201C;Went out for a sec. Wanted to see if you were coming back.&#x201D;</p>
<p> She became aware of the bananas and uncoiled herself tableward.</p>
<p> What special suspicion could I have? None indeed&#x2013;but those muddy,</p>
<p>moony eyes of hers, that singular warmth emanating from her! I said nothing.</p>
<p>I looked at the road meandering so distinctly within the frame of the</p>
<p>window. . . Anybody wishing to betray my trust would have found it a</p>
<p>splendid lookout. With rising appetite, Lo applied herself to the fruit. All</p>
<p>at once I remembered the ingratiating grin of the Johnny next door. I</p>
<p>stepped out quickly. All cars had disappeared except his station wagon; his</p>
<p>pregnant young wife was not getting into it with her baby and the other,</p>
<p>more or less canceled, child.</p>
<p> &#x201C;What&#x2019;s the matter, where are you going?&#x201D; cried Lo from the porch.</p>
<p> I said nothing. I pushed her softness back into the room and went in</p>
<p>after her. I ripped her shirt off. I unzipped the rest of her, I tore off</p>
<p>her sandals. Wildly, I pursued the shadow of her infidelity; but the scent I</p>
<p>traveled upon was so slight as to be practically undistinguishable from a</p>
<p>madman&#x2019;s fancy.</p>
<p> 17</p>
<p> Gros Gaston, in his prissy way, had liked to make</p>
<p>presents&#x2013;presents just a prissy wee bit out of the ordinary, or so he</p>
<p>prissily thought. Noticing one night that my box of chessmen was broken, he</p>
<p>sent me next morning, with a little lad of his, a copper case: it had an</p>
<p>elaborate Oriental design over the lid and could be securely locked. Once</p>
<p>glance sufficed to assure me that it was one of those cheap money boxes</p>
<p>called for some reason &#x201C;luizettas&#x201D; that you buy in Algiers and elsewhere,</p>
<p>and wonder what to do with afterwards. It turned out to be much too flat for</p>
<p>holding my bulky chessmen, but I kept it&#x2013;using it for a totally different</p>
<p>purpose.</p>
<p> In order to break some pattern of fate in which I obscurely felt myself</p>
<p>being enmeshed, I had decided&#x2013;despite Lo&#x2019;s visible annoyance&#x2013;to spend</p>
<p>another night at Chestnut Court; definitely waking up at four in the</p>
<p>morning, I ascertained that Lo was still sound asleep (mouth open, in a kind</p>
<p>of dull amazement at the curiously inane life we all had rigged up for her)</p>
<p>and satisfied myself that the precious contents of the &#x201C;luizetta&#x201D; were safe.</p>
<p>There, snugly wrapped in a white woolen scarf, lay a pocket automatic:</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (154 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>caliber .32, capacity of magazine 8 cartridges, length a little under one</p>
<p>ninth of Lolita&#x2019;s length, stock checked walnut, finish full blued. I had</p>
<p>inherited it from the late Harold Haze, with a 1938 catalog which cheerily</p>
<p>said in part: &#x201C;Particularly well adapted for use in the home and car as well</p>
<p>as on the person.&#x201D; There it lay, ready for instant service on the person or</p>
<p>persons, loaded and fully cocked with the slide lock in safety position,</p>
<p>thus precluding any accidental discharge. We must remember that a pistol is</p>
<p>the Freudian symbol of the Ur-father&#x2019;s central forelimb.</p>
<p> I was now glad I had it with me&#x2013;and even more glad that I had learned</p>
<p>to use it two years before, in the pine forest around my and Charlotte&#x2019;s</p>
<p>glass lake. Farlow, with whom I had roamed those remote woods, was an</p>
<p>admirable marksman, and with his .38 actually managed to hit a hummingbird,</p>
<p>though I must say not much of it could be retrieved for proof&#x2013;only a little</p>
<p>iridescent fluff. A burley ex-policeman called Krestovski, who in the</p>
<p>twenties had shot and killed two escaped convicts, joined us and bagged a</p>
<p>tiny woodpecker&#x2013;completely out of season, incidentally. Between those two</p>
<p>sportsmen I of course was a novice and kept missing everything, though I did</p>
<p>would a squirrel on a later occasion when I went out alone. &#x201C;You like here,&#x201D;</p>
<p>I whispered to my light-weight compact little chum, and then toasted it with</p>
<p>a dram of gin.</p>
<p> 18</p>
<p> The reader must now forget Chestnuts and Colts, and accompany us</p>
<p>further west. The following days were marked by a number of great</p>
<p>thunderstorms&#x2013;or perhaps, thee was but one single storm which progressed</p>
<p>across country in ponderous frogleaps and which we could not shake off just</p>
<p>as we could not shake off detective Trapp: for it was during those days that</p>
<p>the problem of the Aztec Red Convertible presented itself to me, and quite</p>
<p>overshadowed the theme of Lo&#x2019;s lovers.</p>
<p> Queer! I who was jealous of every male we met&#x2013;queer, how I</p>
<p>misinterpreted the designations of doom. Perhaps I had been lulled by Lo&#x2019;s</p>
<p>modest behavior in winter, and anyway it would have been too foolish even</p>
<p>for a lunatic to suppose another Humbert was avidly following Humbert and</p>
<p>Humbert&#x2019;s nymphet with Jovian fireworks, over the great and ugly plains. I</p>
<p>surmised, donc, that the Red Yak keeping behind us at a discreet</p>
<p>distance mile after mile was operated by a detective whom some busybody had</p>
<p>hired to see what exactly Humbert Humbert was doing with that minor</p>
<p>stepdaughter of his. As happens with me at periods of electrical disturbance</p>
<p>and crepitating lightnings, I had hallucinations. Maybe they were more than</p>
<p>hallucinations. I do not know what she or he, or both had put into my liquor</p>
<p>but one night I felt sure somebody was tapping on the door of our cabin, and</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (155 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>I flung it open, and noticed two things&#x2013;that I was stark naked and that,</p>
<p>white-glistening in the rain-dripping darkness, there stood a man holding</p>
<p>before his face the mask of Jutting Chin, a grotesque sleuth in the funnies.</p>
<p>He emitted a muffled guffaw and scurried away, and I reeled back into the</p>
<p>room, and fell asleep again, and am not sure even to this day that the visit</p>
<p>was not a drug-provoked dream: I have thoroughly studied Trapp&#x2019;s type of</p>
<p>humor, and this might have been a plausible sample. Oh, crude and absolutely</p>
<p>ruthless! Somebody, I imagined, was making money on those masks of popular</p>
<p>monsters and morons. Did I see next morning two urchins rummaging in a</p>
<p>garbage can and trying on Jutting Chin? I wonder. It may all have been a</p>
<p>coincidence&#x2013;due to atmospheric conditions, I suppose.</p>
<p> Being a murderer with a sensational but incomplete and unorthodox</p>
<p>memory, I cannot tell you, ladies and gentlemen, the exact day when I first</p>
<p>knew with utter certainty that the red convertible was following us. I do</p>
<p>remember, however, the first time I saw its driver quite clearly. I was</p>
<p>proceeding slowly one afternoon through torrents of rain and kept seeing</p>
<p>that red ghost swimming and shivering with lust in my mirror, when presently</p>
<p>the deluge dwindled to a patter, and then was suspended altogether. With a</p>
<p>swishing sound a sunburst swept the highway, and needing a pair of new</p>
<p>sunglasses, I pussled up at a filling station. What was happening was a</p>
<p>sickness, a cancer, that could not be helped, so I simply ignored the fact</p>
<p>that our quiet pursuer, in his converted state, stopped a little behind us</p>
<p>at a cafe or bar bearing the idiotic sign: The Bustle: A Deceitful Seatful.</p>
<p>Having seen to the needs of my car, I walked into the office to get those</p>
<p>glasses and pay for the gas. As I was in the act of signing a traveler&#x2019;s</p>
<p>check and wondered about my exact whereabouts, I happened to glance through</p>
<p>a side window, and saw a terrible thing. A broad-backed man, baldish, in an</p>
<p>oatmeal coat and dark-brown trousers, was listening to Lo who was leaning</p>
<p>out of the car and talking to him very rapidly, her hand with outspread</p>
<p>fingers going up and down as it did when she was very serious and emphatic.</p>
<p>What struck me with sickening force was&#x2013;how should I put it?&#x2013;the voluble</p>
<p>familiarity of her way, as if they had known each other&#x2013;oh, for weeks and</p>
<p>weeks. I saw him scratch his cheek and nod, and turn, and walk back to his</p>
<p>convertible, a broad and thickish man of my age, somewhat resembling Gustave</p>
<p>Trapp, a cousin of my father&#x2019;s in Switzerland&#x2013;same smoothly tanned face,</p>
<p>fuller than mine, with a small dark mustache and a rosebud degenerate mouth.</p>
<p>Lolita was studying a road map when I got back into the car.</p>
<p> &#x201C;What did that man ask you, Lol?&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Man? Oh, that man. Oh yes. Oh, I don&#x2019;t know. He wondered if I had a</p>
<p>map. Lost his way, I guess.&#x201D;</p>
<p> We drove on, and I said:</p>
<p> &#x201C;Now listen, Lo. I do not know whether you are lying or not, and I do</p>
<p>not know whether you are insane or not, and I do not care for the moment;</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (156 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>but that person has been following us all day, and his car was at the motel</p>
<p>yesterday, and I think he is a cop. You know perfectly well what will happen</p>
<p>and where you will go if the police find out about things. Now I want to</p>
<p>know exactly what he said to you and what you told him.&#x201D;</p>
<p> She laughed.</p>
<p> &#x201C;If he&#x2019;s really a cop,&#x201D; she said shrilly but not illogically, &#x201C;the</p>
<p>worst thing we could do, would be to show him we are scared. Ignore him,</p>
<p>Dad.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Did he ask where we were going?&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Oh, he knows that&#x201D; (mocking me).</p>
<p> &#x201C;Anyway,&#x201D; I said, giving up, &#x201C;I have seen his face now. He is not</p>
<p>pretty. He looks exactly like a relative of mine called Trapp.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Perhaps he is Trapp. If I were you&#x2013;Oh, look, all the nines are</p>
<p>changing into the next thousand. When I was a little kid,&#x201D; she continued</p>
<p>unexpectedly, &#x201C;I used to think they&#x2019;d stop and go back to nines, if only my</p>
<p>mother agreed to put the car in reverse.&#x201D;</p>
<p> It was the first time, I think, she spoke spontaneously of her</p>
<p>pre-Humbertian childhood; perhaps, the theatre had taught her that trick;</p>
<p>and silently we traveled on, unpursued.</p>
<p> But next day, like pain in a fatal disease that comes back as the drug</p>
<p>and hope wear off, there it was again behind us, that glossy red beast. The</p>
<p>traffic on the highway was light that day; nobody passed anybody; and nobody</p>
<p>attempted to get in between our humble blue car and its imperious red</p>
<p>shadow&#x2013;as if there were some spell cast on that interspace, a zone of evil</p>
<p>mirth and magic, a zone whose very precision and stability had a glass-like</p>
<p>virtue that was almost artistic. The driver behind me, with his stuffed</p>
<p>shoulders and Trappish mustache, looked like a display dummy, and his</p>
<p>convertible seemed to move only because an invisible rope of silent silk</p>
<p>connected it with out shabby vehicle. We were many times weaker than his</p>
<p>splendid, lacquered machine, so that I did not even attempt to outspeed him.</p>
<p>O lente currite noctis equi! O softly run, nightmares! We climbed</p>
<p>long grades and rolled downhill again, and heeded speed limits, and spared</p>
<p>slow children, and reproduced in sweeping terms the black wiggles of curves</p>
<p>on their yellow shields, and no matter how and where we drove, the enchanted</p>
<p>interspace slid on intact, mathematical, mirage-like, the viatic counterpart</p>
<p>of a magic carpet. And all the time I was aware of a private blaze on my</p>
<p>right: her joyful eye, her flaming cheek.</p>
<p> A traffic policeman, deep in the nightmare of crisscross streets&#x2013;at</p>
<p>half-past-four p.m. in a factory town&#x2013;was the hand of chance that</p>
<p>interrupted the spell. He beckoned me on, and then with the same hand cut</p>
<p>off my shadow. A score of cars were launched in between us, and I sped on,</p>
<p>and deftly turned into a narrow lane. A sparrow alighted with a jumbo bread</p>
<p>crumb, was tackled by another, and lost the crumb.</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (157 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p> When after a few grim stoppages and a bit of deliberate meandering, I</p>
<p>returned to the highway, our shadow had disappeared.</p>
<p> Lola snorted and said: &#x201C;If he is what you think he is, how silly to</p>
<p>give him the slip.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;I have other notions by now,&#x201D; I said.</p>
<p> &#x201C;You should&#x2013;ah&#x2013;check them by&#x2013;ah&#x2013;keeping in touch with him, fahther</p>
<p>deah,&#x201D; said Lo, writhing in the coils of her own sarcasm. &#x201C;Gee, you</p>
<p>are mean,&#x201D; she added in her ordinary voice.</p>
<p> We spent a grim night in a very foul cabin, under a sonorous amplitude</p>
<p>of rain, and with a kind of prehistorically loud thunder incessantly rolling</p>
<p>above us.</p>
<p> &#x201C;I am not a lady and do not like lightning,&#x201D; said Lo, whose dread of</p>
<p>electric storms gave me some pathetic solace.</p>
<p> We had breakfast in the township of Soda, pop. 1001.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Judging by the terminal figure,&#x201D; I remarked, &#x201C;Fatface is already</p>
<p>here.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Your humor,&#x201D; said Lo, &#x201C;is sidesplitting, deah fahther.&#x201D;</p>
<p> We were in sage-brush country by that time, and there was a day or two</p>
<p>of lovely release (I had been a fool, all was well, that discomfort was</p>
<p>merely a trapped flatus), and presently the mesas gave way to real</p>
<p>mountains, and, on time, we drove into Wace.</p>
<p> Oh, disaster. Some confusion had occurred, she had misread a date in</p>
<p>the Tour Book, and the Magic Cave ceremonies were over! She took it bravely,</p>
<p>I must admit&#x2013;and, when we discovered there was in kurortish Wace a summer</p>
<p>theatre in full swing, we naturally drifted toward it one fair mid-June</p>
<p>evening. I really could not tell you the plot of the play we saw. A trivial</p>
<p>affair, no doubt, with self-conscious light effects and a mediocre leading</p>
<p>lady. The only detail that pleased me was a garland of seven little graces,</p>
<p>more or less immobile, prettily painted, barelimbed&#x2013;seven bemused pubescent</p>
<p>girls in colored gauze that had been recruited locally (judging by the</p>
<p>partisan flurry here and there among the audience) and were supposed to</p>
<p>represent a living rainbow, which lingered throughout the last act, and</p>
<p>rather teasingly faded behind a series of multiplied veils. I remember</p>
<p>thinking that this idea of children-colors had been lifted by authors Clare</p>
<p>Quilty and Vivian Darkbloom from a passage in James Joyce, and that two of</p>
<p>the colors were quite exasperatingly lovely&#x2013;Orange who kept fidgeting all</p>
<p>the time, and Emerald who, when her eyes got used to the pitch-black pit</p>
<p>where we all heavily sat, suddenly smiled at her mother or her protector.</p>
<p> As soon as the thing was over, and manual applause&#x2013;a sound my nerves</p>
<p>cannot stand&#x2013;began to crash all around me, I started to pull and push Lo</p>
<p>toward the exit, in my so natural amorous impatience to get her back to our</p>
<p>neon-blue cottage in the stunned, starry night: I always say nature is</p>
<p>stunned by the sights she sees. Dolly-Lo, however, lagged behind, in a rosy</p>

<p>daze, her pleased eyes narrowed, her sense of vision swamping the rest of</p>
<p>her senses to such an extent that her limp hands hardly came together at all</p>
<p>in the mechanical action of clapping they still went through. I had seen</p>
<p>that kind of thing in children before but, by God, this was a special child,</p>
<p>myopically beaming at the already remote stage where I glimpsed something of</p>
<p>the joint authors&#x2013;a man&#x2019;s tuxedo and the bare shoulders of a hawk-like,</p>
<p>black-haired, strikingly tall woman.</p>
<p> &#x201C;You&#x2019;ve again hurt my wrist, you brute,&#x201D; said Lolita in a small voice</p>
<p>as she slipped into her car seat.</p>
<p> &#x201C;I am dreadfully sorry, my darling, my own ultraviolet darling,&#x201D; I</p>
<p>said, unsuccessfully trying to catch her elbow, and I added, to change the</p>
<p>conversation&#x2013;to change the direction of fate, oh God, oh God: &#x201C;Vivian is</p>
<p>quite a woman. I am sure we saw her yesterday in that restaurant, in Soda</p>
<p>pop.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Sometimes,&#x201D; said Lo, &#x201C;you are quite revoltingly dumb. First, Vivian is</p>
<p>the male author, the gal author is Clare; and second, she is forty, married</p>
<p>and has Negro blood.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;I thought,&#x201D; I said kidding her, &#x201C;Quilty was an ancient flame of yours,</p>
<p>in the days when you loved me, in sweet old Ramsdale.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;What?&#x201D; countered Lo, her features working. &#x201C;that fat dentist? You must</p>
<p>be confusing me with some other fast little article.&#x201D;</p>
<p> And I thought to myself how those fast little articles forget</p>
<p>everything, everything, while we, old lovers, treasure every inch of their</p>
<p>nymphancy.</p>
<p> 19</p>
<p> With Lo&#x2019;s knowledge and assent, the two post offices given to the</p>
<p>Beardsley postmaster as forwarding addresses were P.O. Wace and P.O.</p>
<p>Elphinstone. Next morning we visited the former and had to wait in a short</p>
<p>but slow queue. Serene Lo studied the rogues&#x2019; gallery. Handsome Bryan</p>
<p>Bryanski, alias Anthony Bryan, alias Tony Brown, eyes hazel, complexion</p>
<p>fair, was wanted for kidnapping. A sad-eyed old gentleman&#x2019;s faux-pas was</p>
<p>mail fraud, and, as if that were not enough, he was cursed with deformed</p>
<p>arches. Sullen Sullivan came with a caution: Is believed armed, and should</p>
<p>be considered extremely dangerous. If you want to make a movie out of my</p>
<p>book, have one of these faces gently melt into my own, while I look. And</p>
<p>moreover there was a smudgy snapshot of a Missing Girl, age fourteen,</p>
<p>wearing brown shoes when last seen, rhymes. Please notify Sheriff Buller.</p>
<p> I forget my letters; as to Dolly&#x2019;s, there was her report and a very</p>
<p>special-looking envelope. This I deliberately opened and perused its</p>
<p>contents. I concluded I was doing the foreseen since she did not seem to</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (159 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>mind and drifted toward the newsstand near the exit.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Dolly-Lo: Well, the play was a grand success. All three hounds lay</p>
<p>quiet having been slightly drugged by Cutler, I suspect, and Linda knew all</p>
<p>your lines. She was fine, she had alertness and control, but lacked somehow</p>
<p>the responsiveness, the relaxed vitality, the charm of</p>
<p>my&#x2013;and the author&#x2019;s&#x2013;Diana; but there was no author to applaud us as</p>
<p>last time, and the terrific electric storm outside interfered with our own</p>
<p>modest offstage thunder. Oh dear, life does fly. Now that everything is</p>
<p>over, school, play, the Roy mess, mother&#x2019;s confinement (our baby, alas, did</p>
<p>not live!), it all seems such a long time ago, though practically I still</p>
<p>bear traces of the paint.</p>
<p> &#x201C;We are going to New York after tomorrow, and I guess I can&#x2019;t manage to</p>
<p>wriggle out of accompanying my parents to Europe. I have even worse news for</p>
<p>you. Dolly-Lo! I may not be back at Beardsley if and when you return. With</p>
<p>one thing and another, one being you know who, and the other not being who</p>
<p>you think you know, Dad wants me to go to school in Paris for one year while</p>
<p>he and Fullbright are around.</p>
<p> &#x201C;As expected, poor Poet stumbled in Scene III when arriving at the bit</p>
<p>of French nonsense. Remember? Ne manque pas de dire &#xFE; ton amant, Chim&#xF5;ne,</p>
<p>comme le lac est beau car il faut qu&#x2019;il t&#x2019;y m&#xE8;ne. Lucky beau! Qu&#x2019;il</p>
<p>t&#x2019;y&#x2013;What a tongue-twister! Well, be good, Lollikins. Best love from</p>
<p>your Poet, and best regards to the Governor. Your Mona. P.S. Because of one</p>
<p>thing and another, my correspondence happens to be rigidly controlled. So</p>
<p>better wait till I write you from Europe.&#x201D; (She never did as far as I know.</p>
<p>The letter contained an element of mysterious nastiness that I am too tired</p>
<p>today to analyze. I found it later preserved in one of the Tour Books, and</p>
<p>give it here &#xFE; titre documentaire. I read it twice.)</p>
<p> I looked up from the letter and was about to&#x2013;There was no Lo to</p>
<p>behold. While I was engrossed in Mona&#x2019;s witchery, Lo had shrugged her</p>
<p>shoulders and vanished. &#x201C;Did you happen to see&#x2013;&#x201D; I asked of a hunchback</p>
<p>sweeping the floor near the entrance. He had, the old lecherer. He guessed</p>
<p>she had seen a friend and had hurried out. I hurried out too. I stopped&#x2013;she</p>
<p>had not. I hurried on. I stopped again. It had happened at last. She had</p>
<p>gone for ever.</p>
<p> In later years I have often wondered why she did not go forever</p>
<p>that day. Was it the retentive quality of her new summer clothes in my</p>
<p>locked car? Was it some unripe particle in some general plan? Was it simply</p>
<p>because, all things considered, I might as well be used to convey her to</p>
<p>Elphinstone&#x2013;the secret terminus, anyway? I only know I was quite certain</p>
<p>she had left me for ever. The noncommittal mauve mountains half encircling</p>
<p>the town seemed to me to swarm with panting, scrambling, laughing, panting</p>
<p>Lolitas who dissolved in their haze. A big W made of white stones on a steep</p>
<p>talus in the far vista of a cross street seemed the very initial of woe.</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (160 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p> The new and beautiful post office I had just emerged from stood between</p>
<p>a dormant movie house and a conspiracy of poplars. The time was 9 a.m.</p>
<p>mountain time. The street was charming it into beauty, was one of those</p>
<p>fragile young summer mornings with flashes of glass here and there and a</p>
<p>general air of faltering and almost fainting at the prospect of an</p>
<p>intolerably torrid noon. Crossing over, I loafed and leafed, as it were,</p>
<p>through one long block: Drugs, Real Estate, Fashions, Auto Parts, Cafe,</p>
<p>Sporting Goods, Real Estate, Furniture, Appliances, Western Union, Cleaners,</p>
<p>Grocery. Officer, officer, my daughter has run away. In collusion with a</p>
<p>detective; in love with a black-mailer. Took advantage of my utter</p>
<p>helplessness. I peered into all the stores. I deliberated inly if I should</p>
<p>talk to any of the sparse foot-passengers. I did not. I sat for a while in</p>
<p>the parked car. I inspected the public garden on the east side. I went back</p>
<p>to Fashions and Auto Parts. I told myself with a burst of furious</p>
<p>sarcasm&#x2013;un ricanement&#x2013;that I was crazy to suspect her, that she</p>
<p>would turn up any minute.</p>
<p> She did.</p>
<p> I wheeled around and shook off the hand she had placed on my sleeve</p>
<p>with a timid and imbecile smile.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Get into the car,&#x201D; I said.</p>
<p> She obeyed, and I went on pacing up and down, struggling with nameless</p>
<p>thoughts, trying to plan some way of tackling her duplicity.</p>
<p> Presently she left the car and was at my side again. My sense of</p>
<p>hearing gradually got tuned in to station Lo again, and I became aware she</p>
<p>was telling me that she had met a former girl friend.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Yes? Whom?&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;A Beardsley girl.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Good. I now every name in your group. Alice Adams?&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;The girl was not in my group.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Good. I have a complete student list with me. Her name please.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;She was not in my school She is just a town girl in Beardsley.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Good. I have the Beardsley directory with me too. We&#x2019;ll look up all</p>
<p>the Browns.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;I only know her first name.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Mary or Jane?&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;No&#x2013;Dolly, like me.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;So that&#x2019;s the dead end&#x201D; (the mirror you break your nose against).</p>
<p>&#x201C;Good. Let us try another angle. You have been absent twenty-eight minutes.</p>
<p>What did the two Dollys do?&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;We went to a drugstore.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;And you had there&#x2013;?&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Oh, just a couple of Cokes.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Careful, Dolly. We can check that, you know.&#x201D;</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (161 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p> &#x201C;At least, she had. I had a glass of water.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Good. Was it that place there?&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Sure.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Good, come on, we&#x2019;ll grill the soda jerk.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Wait a sec. Come to think it might have been further down&#x2013;just around</p>
<p>the corner.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Come on all the same. Go in please. Well, let&#x2019;s see.&#x201D; (Opening a</p>
<p>chained telephone book.) &#x201C;Dignified Funeral Service. NO, not yet. Here we</p>
<p>are: Druggists-Retail. Hill Drug Store. Larkin&#x2019;s Pharmacy. And two more.</p>
<p>That&#x2019;s all Wace seems to have in the way of soda fountains&#x2013;at least in the</p>
<p>business section. Well, we will check them all.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Go to hell,&#x201D; she said.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Lo, rudeness will get you nowhere.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Okay,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;But you&#x2019;re not going to trap me. Okay, so we did not</p>
<p>have a pop. We just talked and looked at dresses in show windows.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Which? That window there for example?&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Yes, that one there, for example.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Oh Lo! Let&#x2019;s look closer at it.&#x201D;</p>
<p> It was indeed a pretty sight. A dapper young fellow was vacuum-cleaning</p>
<p>a carpet upon which stood two figures that looked as if some blast had just</p>
<p>worked havoc with them. One figure was stark naked, wigless and armless. Its</p>
<p>comparatively small stature and smirking pose suggested that when clothed it</p>
<p>had represented, and would represent when clothed again, a girl-child of</p>
<p>Lolita&#x2019;s size. But in its present state it was sexless. Next to it, stood a</p>
<p>much taller veiled bride, quite perfect and intact except for the</p>
<p>lack of one arm. On the floor, at the feet of these damsels, where the man</p>
<p>crawled about laboriously with his cleaner, there lay a cluster of three</p>
<p>slender arms, and a blond wig. Two of the arms happened to be twisted and</p>
<p>seemed to suggest a clasping gesture of horror and supplication.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Look, Lo,&#x201D; I said quietly. &#x201C;Look well. Is not that a rather good</p>
<p>symbol of something or other? However&#x201D;&#x2013;I went on as we got back into the</p>
<p>car&#x2013;&#x201D;I have taken certain precautions. Here (delicately opening the glove</p>
<p>compartment), on this pad I have our boy friend&#x2019;s car number.&#x201D;</p>
<p> As the ass I was I had not memorized it. What remained of it in my mind</p>
<p>were the initial letter and the closing figure as if the whole amphitheater</p>
<p>of six signs receded concavely behind a tinted glass too opaque to allow the</p>
<p>central series to be deciphered, but just translucent enough to make out its</p>
<p>extreme edges&#x2013;a capital P and a 6. I have to go into those details (which</p>
<p>in themselves can interest only a professional psychologue) because</p>
<p>otherwise the reader (ah, if I could visualize him as a blond-bearded</p>
<p>scholar with rosy lips sucking la pomme de sa canne as he quaffs my</p>
<p>manuscript!) might not understand the quality of the shock I experienced</p>
<p>upon noticing that the P had acquired the bustle of a B and that the 6 had</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (162 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>been deleted altogether. The rest, with erasures revealing the hurried</p>
<p>shuttle smear of a pencil&#x2019;s rubber end, and with parts of numbers</p>
<p>obliterated or reconstructed in a child&#x2019;s hand, presented a tangle of barbed</p>
<p>wire to any logical interpretation. All I knew was the state&#x2013;one adjacent</p>
<p>to the state Beardsley was in.</p>
<p> I said nothing. I put the pad back, closed the compartment, and drove</p>
<p>out of Wace. Lo had grabbed some comics from the back seat and,</p>
<p>mobile-white-bloused, one brown elbow out of the window, was deep in the</p>
<p>current adventure of some clout or clown. Three or four miles out of Wace, I</p>
<p>turned into the shadow of a picnic ground where the morning had dumped its</p>
<p>litter of light on an empty table; Lo looked up with a semi-smile of</p>
<p>surprise and without a word I delivered a tremendous backhand cut that</p>
<p>caught her smack on her hot hard little cheekbone.</p>
<p> And then the remorse, the poignant sweetness of sobbing atonement,</p>
<p>groveling love, the hopelessness of sensual reconciliation. In the velvet</p>
<p>night, at Mirana Motel (Mirana!) I kissed the yellowish soles of her</p>
<p>long-toed feet, I immolated myself . . . But it was all of no avail. both</p>
<p>doomed were we. And soon I was to enter a new cycle of persecution.</p>
<p> In a street of Wace, on its outskirts . . . Oh, I am quite sure it was</p>
<p>not a delusion. In a street of Wace, I had glimpsed the Aztec Red</p>
<p>Convertible, or its identical twin. Instead of Trapp, it contained four or</p>
<p>five loud young people of several sexes&#x2013;but I said nothing. After Wace a</p>
<p>totally new situation arose. For a day or two, I enjoyed the mental emphasis</p>
<p>with which I told myself that we were not, and never had been followed; and</p>
<p>then I became sickeningly conscious that Trapp had changed his tactics and</p>
<p>was still with us, in this or that rented car.</p>
<p> A veritable Proteus of the highway, with bewildering ease he switched</p>
<p>from one vehicle to another. This technique implied the existence of garages</p>
<p>specializing in &#x201C;stage-automobile&#x201D; operations, but I never could discover</p>
<p>the remises he used. He seemed to patronize at first the Chevrolet genus,</p>
<p>beginning with a Campus Cream convertible, then going on to a small Horizon</p>
<p>Blue sedan, and thenceforth fading into Surf Gray and Driftwood Gray. Then</p>
<p>he turned to other makes and passed through a pale dull rainbow of paint</p>
<p>shades, and one day I found myself attempting to cope with the subtle</p>
<p>distinction between our own Dream Blue Melmoth and the Crest Blue Oldsmobile</p>
<p>he had rented; grays, however, remained his favorite cryptochromism, and, in</p>
<p>agonizing nightmares, I tried in vain to sort out properly such ghosts as</p>
<p>Chrysler&#x2019;s Shell Gray, Chevrolet&#x2019;s Thistle Gray, Dodge&#x2019;s French Gray . . .</p>
<p> The necessity of being constantly on the lookout for his little</p>
<p>mustache and open shirt&#x2013;or for his baldish pate and broad shoulders&#x2013;led me</p>
<p>to a profound study of all cars on the road&#x2013;behind, before, alongside,</p>
<p>coming, going, every vehicle under the dancing sun: the quiet vacationist&#x2019;s</p>
<p>automobile with the box of Tender-Touch tissues in the back window; the</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (163 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>recklessly speeding jalopy full of pale children with a shaggy dog&#x2019;s head</p>
<p>protruding, and a crumpled mudguard; the bachelor&#x2019;s tudor sedan crowded with</p>
<p>suits on hangers; the huge fat house trailer weaving in front, immune to the</p>
<p>Indian file of fury boiling behind it; the car with the young female</p>
<p>passenger politely perched in the middle of the front seat to be closer to</p>
<p>the young male driver; the car carrying on its roof a red boat bottom up . .</p>
<p>. The gray car slowing up before us, the gray car catching up with us.</p>
<p> We were in mountain country, somewhere between Snow and Champion, and</p>
<p>rolling down an almost imperceptible grade, when I had my next distinct view</p>
<p>of Detective Paramour Trapp. The gray mist behind us had deepened and</p>
<p>concentrated into the compactness of a Dominion Blue sedan. All of a sudden,</p>
<p>as if the car I drove responded to my poor heart&#x2019;s pangs, we were slithering</p>
<p>from side to side, with something making a helpless plap-plap-plap under us.</p>
<p> &#x201C;You got a flat, mister,&#x201D; said cheerful Lo.</p>
<p> I pulled up&#x2013;near a precipice. She folded her arms and put her foot on</p>
<p>the dashboard. I got out and examined the right rear wheel. The base of its</p>
<p>tire was sheepishly and hideously square. Trapp had stopped some fifty yards</p>
<p>behind us. His distant face formed a grease spot of mirth. This was my</p>
<p>chance. I started to walk towards him&#x2013;with the brilliant idea of asking him</p>
<p>for a jack through I had one. He backed a little. I stubbed my toe against a</p>
<p>stone&#x2013;and there was a sense of general laughter. Then a tremendous truck</p>
<p>loomed from behind Trapp and thundered by me&#x2013;and immediately after, I heard</p>
<p>it utter a convulsive honk. Instinctively I looked back&#x2013;and saw my own car</p>
<p>gently creeping away. I could make out Lo ludicrously at the wheel, and the</p>
<p>engine was certainly running&#x2013;though I remembered I had cut it but had not</p>
<p>applied the emergency brake; and during the brief space of throb-time that</p>
<p>it took me to reach the croaking machine which came to a standstill at last,</p>
<p>it dawned upon me that during the last two years little Lo had had ample</p>
<p>time to pick up the rudiments of driving. As I wrenched the door open, I was</p>
<p>goddamn sure she had started the car to prevent me from walking up to Trapp.</p>
<p>Her trick proved useless, however, for even while I was puruing her he had</p>
<p>made an energetic U-turn and was gone. I rested for a while. Lo asked wasn&#x2019;t</p>
<p>I going to thank her&#x2013;the car had started to move by itself and&#x2013;Getting no</p>
<p>answer, she immersed herself in a study of the map. I got out again and</p>
<p>commenced the &#x201C;ordeal of the orb,&#x201D; as Charlotte used to say. Perhaps, I was</p>
<p>losing my mind.</p>
<p> We continued our grotesque journey. After a forlorn and useless dip, we</p>
<p>went up and up. On a steep grade I found myself behind the gigantic truck</p>
<p>that had overtaken us. It was now groaning up a winding road and was</p>
<p>impossible to pass. Out of its front part a small oblong of smooth</p>
<p>silver&#x2013;the inner wrapping of chewing gum&#x2013;escaped and flew back into our</p>
<p>windshield. It occurred to me that if I were really losing my mind, I might</p>
<p>end by murdering somebody. In fact&#x2013;said high-and-dry Humbert to floundering</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (164 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>Humbert&#x2013;it might be quite clever to prepare things&#x2013;to transfer the weapon</p>
<p>from box to pocket&#x2013;so as to be ready to take advantage of the spell of</p>
<p>insanity when it does come.</p>
<p> 20</p>
<p> By permitting Lolita to study acting I had, fond fool, suffered her to</p>
<p>cultivate deceit. It now appeared that it had not been merely a matter of</p>
<p>learning the answers to such questions as what is the basic conflict in</p>
<p>&#x201C;Hedda Gabler,&#x201D; or where are the climaxes in &#x201C;Love Under the Lindens,&#x201D; or</p>
<p>analyze the prevailing mood of &#x201C;Cherry Orchard&#x201D;; it was really a matter of</p>
<p>learning to betray me. How I deplored now the exercises in sensual</p>
<p>simulation that I had so often seen her go through in our Beardsley parlor</p>
<p>when I would observe her from some strategic point while she, like a</p>
<p>hypnotic subject of a performer in a mystic rite, produced sophisticated</p>
<p>version of infantile make-believe by going through the mimetic actions of</p>
<p>hearing a moan in the dark, seeing for the first time a brand new young</p>
<p>stepmother, tasting something she hated, such as buttermilk, smelling</p>
<p>crushed grass in a lush orchard, or touching mirages of objects with her</p>
<p>sly, slender, girl-child hands. Among my papers I still have a mimeographed</p>
<p>sheet suggesting:</p>
<p> Tactile drill. Imagine Yourself picking up and holding: a pingpong</p>
<p>ball, an apple, a sticky date, a new flannel-fluffed tennis ball, a hot</p>
<p>potato, an ice cube, a kitten, a puppy, a horseshoe, a feather, a</p>
<p>flashlight.</p>
<p> Knead with your fingers the following imaginary things: a piece of</p>
<p>brad, india rubber, a friend&#x2019;s aching temple, a sample of velvet, a rose</p>
<p>petal.</p>
<p> You are a blind girl. Palpate the face of: a Greek youth, Cyrano, Santa</p>
<p>Claus, a baby, a laughing faun, a sleeping stranger, your father.</p>
<p> But she had been so pretty in the weaving of those delicate spells, in</p>
<p>the dreamy performance of her enchantments and duties! On certain</p>
<p>adventurous evenings, in Beardsley, I also had her dance for me with the</p>
<p>promise of some treat or gift, and although these routine leg-parted leaps</p>
<p>of hers were more like those of a football cheerleader than like the</p>
<p>languorous and jerky motions of a Parisian petit rat, the rhythms of</p>
<p>her not quite nubile limbs had given me pleasure. But all that was nothing,</p>
<p>absolutely nothing, to the indescribable itch of rapture that her tennis</p>
<p>game produced in me&#x2013;the teasing delirious feeling of teetering on the very</p>
<p>brink of unearthly order and splendor.</p>

<p> Despite her advanced age, she was more of a nymphet than ever, with her</p>
<p>apricot-colored limbs, in her sub-teen tennis togs! Winged gentlemen! No</p>
<p>hereafter is acceptable if it does not produce her as she was then, in that</p>
<p>Colorado resort between Snow and Elphinstone, with everything right: the</p>
<p>white wide little-boy shorts, the slender waist, the apricot midriff, the</p>
<p>white breast-kerchief whose ribbons went up and encircled her neck to end</p>
<p>behind in a dangling knot leaving bare her gaspingly young and adorable</p>
<p>apricot shoulder blades with that pubescence and those lovely gentle bones,</p>
<p>and the smooth, downward-tapering back. Her cap had a white peak. Her racket</p>
<p>had cost me a small fortune. Idiot, triple idiot! I could have filmed her! I</p>
<p>would have had her now with me, before my eyes, in the projection room of my</p>
<p>pain and despair!</p>
<p> She would wait and relax for a bar or two of white-lined time before</p>
<p>going into the act of serving, and often bounced the ball once or twice, or</p>
<p>pawed the ground a little, always at ease, always rather vague about the</p>
<p>score, always cheerful as she so seldom was in the dark life she led at</p>
<p>home. Her tennis was the highest point to which I can imagine a young</p>
<p>creature bringing the art of make-believe, although I daresay, for her it</p>
<p>was the very geometry of basic reality.</p>
<p> The exquisite clarity of all her movements had its auditory counterpart</p>
<p>in the pure ringing sound of her every stroke. The ball when it entered her</p>
<p>aura of control became somehow whiter, its resilience somehow richer, and</p>
<p>the instrument of precision she used upon it seemed inordinately prehensile</p>
<p>and deliberate at the moment of clinging contact. Her form was, indeed, an</p>
<p>absolutely perfect imitation of absolutely top-notch tennis&#x2013;without any</p>
<p>utilitarian results. As Edusa&#x2019;s sister, Electra Gold, a marvelous young</p>
<p>coach, said to me once while I sat on a pulsating hard bench watching</p>
<p>Dolores Haze toying with Linda Hall (and being beaten by her): &#x201C;Dolly has a</p>
<p>magnet in the center of her racket guts, but why the heck is she so polite?&#x201D;</p>
<p>Ah, Electra, what did it matter, with such grace! I remember at the very</p>
<p>first game I watched being drenched with an almost painful convulsion of</p>
<p>beauty assimilation. My Lolita had a way of raising her bent left knee at</p>
<p>the ample and springy start of the service cycle when there would develop</p>
<p>and hang in the sun for a second a vital web of balance between toed foot,</p>
<p>pristine armpit, burnished arm and far back-flung racket, as she smiled up</p>
<p>with gleaming teeth at the small globe suspended so high in the zenith of</p>
<p>the powerful and graceful cosmos she had created for the express purpose of</p>
<p>falling upon it with a clean resounding crack of her golden whip.</p>
<p> It had, that serve of hers, beauty, directness, youth, a classical</p>
<p>purity of trajectory, and was, despite its spanking pace, fairly easy to</p>
<p>return, having as it did no twist or sting to its long elegant hop.</p>
<p> That I could have had all her strokes, all her enchantments,</p>
<p>immortalized in segments of celluloid, makes me moan today with frustration.</p>

<p>They would have been so much more than the snapshots I burned! Her overhead</p>
<p>volley was related to her service as the envoy is to the ballade; for she</p>
<p>had been trained, my pet, to patter up at once to the net on her nimble,</p>
<p>vivid, white-shod feet. There was nothing to choose between her forehand and</p>
<p>backhand drives: they were mirror images of one another&#x2013;my very loins still</p>
<p>tingle with those pistol reports repeated by crisp echoes and Electra&#x2019;s</p>
<p>cries. One of the pearls of Dolly&#x2019;s game was a short half-volley that Ned</p>
<p>Litam had taught her in California.</p>
<p> She preferred acting to swimming, and swimming to tennis; yet I insist</p>
<p>that had not something within her been broken by me&#x2013;not that I realized it</p>
<p>then!&#x2013;she would have had on the top of her perfect form the will to win,</p>
<p>and would have become a real girl champion. Dolores, with two rackets under</p>
<p>her arm, in Wimbledon. Dolores endorsing a Dromedary. Dolores turning</p>
<p>professional. Dolores acting a girl champion in a movie. Dolores and her</p>
<p>gray, humble, hushed husband-coach, old Humbert.</p>
<p> There was nothing wrong or deceitful in the spirit of her game&#x2013;unless</p>
<p>one considered her cheerful indifference toward its outcome as the feint of</p>
<p>a nymphet. She who was so cruel and crafty in everyday life, revealed an</p>
<p>innocence, a frankness, a kindness of ball-placing, that permitted a</p>
<p>second-rate but determined player, no matter how uncouth and incompetent, to</p>
<p>poke and cut his way to victory. Despite her small stature, she covered the</p>
<p>one thousand and fifty-three square feet of her half of the court with</p>
<p>wonderful ease, once she had entered into the rhythm of a rally and as long</p>
<p>as she could direct that rhythm; but any abrupt attack, or sudden change of</p>
<p>tactics on her adversary&#x2019;s part, left her helpless. At match point, her</p>
<p>second serve, which&#x2013;rather typically&#x2013;was even stronger and more stylish</p>
<p>than her first (for she had none of the inhibitions that cautious winners</p>
<p>have), would strike vibrantly the hard-cord of the net&#x2013;and ricochet out of</p>
<p>court. The polished gem of her dropshot was snapped up and put away by an</p>
<p>opponent who seemed four-legged and wielded a crooked paddle. Her dramatic</p>
<p>drives and lovely volleys would candidly fall at his feet. Over and over</p>
<p>again she would land an easy one into the net&#x2013;and merrily mimic dismay by</p>
<p>drooping in a ballet attitude, with her forelocks hanging. So sterile were</p>
<p>her grace and whipper that she could not even win from panting me and my</p>
<p>old-fashioned lifting drive.</p>
<p> I suppose I am especially susceptible to the magic of games. In my</p>
<p>chess sessions with Gaston I saw the board as a square pool of limpid water</p>
<p>with rare shells and stratagems rosily visible upon the smooth tessellated</p>
<p>bottom, which to my confused adversary was all ooze and squid-cloud.</p>
<p>Similarly, the initial tennis coaching I had inflicted on Lolita&#x2013;prior to</p>
<p>the revelations that came to her through the great Californian&#x2019;s</p>
<p>lessons&#x2013;remained in my mind as oppressive and distressful memories&#x2013;not</p>
<p>only because she had been so hopelessly and irritatingly irritated by every</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (167 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>suggestion of mine&#x2013;but because the precious symmetry of the court instead</p>
<p>of reflecting the harmonies latent in her was utterly jumbled by the</p>
<p>clumsiness and lassitude of the resentful child I mistaught. Now things were</p>
<p>different, and on that particular day, in the pure air of Champion,</p>
<p>Colorado, on that admirable court at the foot of seep stone stairs leading</p>
<p>up to Champion Hotel where we had spent the night, I felt I could rest from</p>
<p>the nightmare of unknown betrayals within the innocence of her style, of her</p>
<p>soul, of her essential grace.</p>
<p> She was hitting hard and flat, with her usual effortless sweep, feeding</p>
<p>me deep skimming balls&#x2013;all so rhythmically coordinated and overt as to</p>
<p>reduce my footwork to, practically, a swinging stroll&#x2013;crack players will</p>
<p>understand what I mean. My rather heavily cut serve that I had been taught</p>
<p>by my father who had learned it from Decugis or Borman, old friends of his</p>
<p>and great champions, would have seriously troubled my Lo, had I really tried</p>
<p>to trouble her. But who would upset such a lucid dear? Did I ever mention</p>
<p>that her bare arm bore the 8 of vaccination? That I loved her hopelessly?</p>
<p>That she was only fourteen?</p>
<p> An inquisitive butterfly passed, dipping, between us.</p>
<p> Two people in tennis shorts, a red-haired fellow only about eight years</p>
<p>my junior, and an indolent dark girl with a moody mouth and hard eyes, about</p>
<p>two years Lolita&#x2019;s senior, appeared from nowhere. As is common with dutiful</p>
<p>tyros, their rackets were sheathed and framed, and they carried them not as</p>
<p>if they were the natural and comfortable extensions of certain specialized</p>
<p>muscles, but hammers or blunderbusses or whimbles, or my own dreadful</p>
<p>cumbersome sins. Rather unceremoniously seating themselves near my precious</p>
<p>coat, on a bench adjacent to the court, they fell to admiring very vocally a</p>
<p>rally of some fifty exchanges that Lo innocently helped me to foster and</p>
<p>uphold&#x2013;until there occurred a syncope in the series causing her to gasp as</p>
<p>her overhead smash went out of court, whereupon she melted into winsome</p>
<p>merriment, my golden pet.</p>
<p> I felt thirsty by then, and walked to the drinking fountain; there Red</p>
<p>approached me and in all humility suggested a mixed double. &#x201C;I am Bill</p>
<p>Mead,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;And that&#x2019;s Fay Page, actress. Maffy On Say&#x201D;&#x2013;he added</p>
<p>(pointing with his ridiculously hooded racket at polished Fay who was</p>
<p>already talking to Dolly). I was about to reply &#x201C;Sorry, but&#x2013;&#x201D; (for I hate</p>
<p>to have my filly involved in the chops and jabs of cheap bunglers), when a</p>
<p>remarkably melodious cry diverted my attention: a bellboy was tripping down</p>
<p>the steps from the hotel to our court and making me signs. I was wanted, if</p>
<p>you please, on an urgent long distance call&#x2013;so urgent in fact that the line</p>
<p>was being held for me. Certainly. I got into my coat (inside pocket heavy</p>
<p>with pistol) and told Lo I would be back in a minute. She was picking up a</p>
<p>ball&#x2013;in the continental foot-racket way which was one of the few nice</p>
<p>things I had taught her,&#x2013;and smiled&#x2013;she smiled at me!</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (168 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p> An awful calm kept my heart afloat as I followed the boy up to the</p>
<p>hotel. This, to use an American term, in which discovery, retribution,</p>
<p>torture, death, eternity appear in the shape of a singularly repulsive</p>
<p>nutshell, was it. I had left her in mediocre hands, but it hardly</p>
<p>mattered now. I would fight, of course. Oh, I would fight. Better destroy</p>
<p>everything than surrender her. Yes, quite a climb.</p>
<p> At the desk, dignified, Roman-nosed man, with, I suggest, a very</p>
<p>obscure past that might reward investigation, handed me a message in his own</p>
<p>hand. The line had not been held after all. The note said:</p>
<p> &#x201C;Mr. Humbert. The head of Birdsley (sic!) School called. Summer</p>
<p>residence&#x2013;Birdsley 2-8282. Please call back immediately. Highly important.&#x201D;</p>
<p> I folded myself into a booth, took a little pill, and four about twenty</p>
<p>minutes tussled with space-spooks. A quartet of propositions gradually</p>
<p>became audible: soprano, there was no such number in Beardsley; alto, Miss</p>
<p>Pratt was on her way to England; tenor, Beardsley School had not telephoned;</p>
<p>bass, they could not have done so, since nobody knew I was, that particular</p>
<p>day, in Champion, Colo. Upon my stinging him, the Roman took the trouble to</p>
<p>find out if there had been a long distance call. There had been none. A fake</p>
<p>call from some local dial was not excluded. I thanked him. He said: You bet.</p>
<p>After a visit to the purling men&#x2019;s room and a stiff drink at the bar, I</p>
<p>started on my return march. From the very first terrace I saw, far below, on</p>
<p>the tennis court which seemed the size of a school child&#x2019;s ill-wiped slate,</p>
<p>golden Lolita playing in a double. She moved like a fair angel among three</p>
<p>horrible Boschian cripples. One of these, her partner, while changing sides,</p>
<p>jocosely slapped her on her behind with his racket. He had a remarkably</p>
<p>round head and wore incongruous brown trousers. There was a momentary</p>
<p>flurry&#x2013;he saw me, and throwing away his racket&#x2013;mine&#x2013;scuttled up the</p>
<p>slope. He waved his wrists and elbows in a would-be comical imitation of</p>
<p>rudimentary wings, as he climbed, blow-legged, to the street, where his gray</p>
<p>car awaited him. Next moment he and the grayness were gone. When I came</p>
<p>down, the remaining trio were collecting and sorting out the balls.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Mr. Mead, who was that person?&#x201D;</p>
<p> Bill and Fay, both looking very solemn, shook their heads.</p>
<p> That absurd intruder had butted in to make up a double, hadn&#x2019;t he,</p>
<p>Dolly?</p>
<p> Dolly. The handle of my racket was still disgustingly warm. Before</p>
<p>returning to the hotel, I ushered her into a little alley half-smothered in</p>
<p>fragrant shrubs, with flowers like smoke, and was about to burst into ripe</p>
<p>sobs and plead with her imperturbed dream in the most abject manner for</p>
<p>clarification, no matter how meretricious, of the slow awfulness enveloping</p>
<p>me, when we found ourselves behind the convulsed Mead twosome&#x2013;assorted</p>
<p>people, you know, meeting among idyllic settings in old comedies. Bill and</p>
<p>Fay were both weak with laughter&#x2013;we had come at the end of their private</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (169 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>joke. It did not really matter.</p>
<p> Speaking as if it really did not really matter, and assuming,</p>
<p>apparently, that life was automatically rolling on with all its routine</p>
<p>pleasures, Lolita said she would like to change into her bathing things, and</p>
<p>spend the rest of the afternoon at the swimming pool. It was a gorgeous day.</p>
<p>Lolita!</p>
<p> 21</p>
<p> &#x201C;Lo! Lola! Lolita!&#x201D; I hear myself crying from a doorway into the sun,</p>
<p>with the acoustics of time, domed time, endowing my call and its tell-tale</p>
<p>hoarseness with such a wealth of anxiety, passion and pain that really it</p>
<p>would have been instrumental in wrenching open the zipper of her nylon</p>
<p>shroud had she been dead. Lolita! In the middle of a trim turfed terrace I</p>
<p>found her at last&#x2013;she had run out before I was ready. Oh Lolita! There she</p>
<p>was playing with a damned dog, not me. The animal, a terrier of sorts, was</p>
<p>losing and snapping up again and adjusting between his jaws a wet little red</p>
<p>ball; he took rapid chords with his front paws on the resilient turf, and</p>
<p>then would bounce away. I had only wanted to see where she was, I could not</p>
<p>swim with my heart in that state, but who cared&#x2013;and there she was, and</p>
<p>there was I, in my robe&#x2013;and so I stopped calling; but suddenly something in</p>
<p>the pattern of her motions, as she dashed this way and that in her Aztec Red</p>
<p>bathing briefs and bra, struck me . . . there was an ecstasy, a madness</p>
<p>about her frolics that was too much of a glad thing. Even the dog seemed</p>
<p>puzzled by the extravagance of her reactions. I put a gentle hand to my</p>
<p>chest as I surveyed the situation. The turquoise blue swimming pool some</p>
<p>distance behind the lawn was no longer behind that lawn, but within my</p>
<p>thorax, and my organs swam in it like excrements in the blue sea water in</p>
<p>Nice. One of the bathers had left the pool and, half-concealed by the</p>
<p>peacocked shade of trees, stood quite still, holding the ends of the towel</p>
<p>around his neck and following Lolita with his amber eyes. There he stood, in</p>
<p>the camouflage of sun and shade, disfigured by them and masked by his own</p>
<p>nakedness, his damp black hair or what was left of it, glued to his round</p>
<p>head, his little mustache a humid smear, the wool on his chest spread like a</p>
<p>symmetrical trophy, his naval pulsating, his hirsute thighs dripping with</p>
<p>bright droplets, his tight wet black bathing trunks bloated and bursting</p>
<p>with vigor where his great fat bullybag was pulled up and back like a padded</p>
<p>shield over his reversed beasthood. And as I looked at his oval nut-brown</p>
<p>face, it dawned upon me that what I had recognized him by was the reflection</p>
<p>of my daughter&#x2019;s countenance&#x2013;the same beatitude and grimace but made</p>
<p>hideous by his maleness. And I also knew that the child, my child, knew he</p>
<p>was looking, enjoyed the lechery of his look and was putting on a show of</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (170 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>gambol and glee, the vile and beloved slut. As she made for the ball and</p>
<p>missed it, she fell on her back, with her obscene young legs madly pedaling</p>
<p>in the air; I could sense the musk of her excitement from where I stood, and</p>
<p>then I saw (petrified with a kind of sacred disgust) the man close his eyes</p>
<p>and bare his small, horribly small and even, teeth as he leaned against a</p>
<p>tree in which a multitude of dappled Priaps shivered. Immediately afterwards</p>
<p>a marvelous transformation took place. He was no longer the satyr but a very</p>
<p>good-natured and foolish Swiss cousin, the Gustave Trapp I have mentioned</p>
<p>more than once, who used to counteract his &#x201C;sprees&#x201D; (he drank beer with</p>
<p>milk, the good swine) by feats of weight-lifting&#x2013;tottering and grunting on</p>
<p>a lake beach with his otherwise very complete bathing suit jauntily stripped</p>
<p>from one shoulder. This Trapp noticed me from afar and working the</p>
<p>towel on his name walked back with false insouciance to the pool. And as if</p>
<p>the sun had gone out of the game, Lo slackened and slowly got up ignoring</p>
<p>the ball that the terrier placed before her. Who can say what heartbreaks</p>
<p>are caused in a dog by our discontinuing a romp? I started to say something,</p>
<p>and then sat down on the grass with a quite monstrous pain in my chest and</p>
<p>vomited a torrent of browns and greens that I had never remembered eating.</p>
<p> I saw Lolita&#x2019;s eyes, and they seemed to be more calculating than</p>
<p>frightened. I heard her saying to a kind lady that her father was having a</p>
<p>fit. Then for a long time I lay in a lounge chair swallowing pony upon pony</p>
<p>of gin. And next morning I felt strong enough to drive on (which in later</p>
<p>years no doctor believed).</p>
<p> 22</p>
<p> The two-room cabin we had ordered at Silver Spur Court, Elphinstone,</p>
<p>turned out to belong to the glossily browned pine-log kind that Lolita used</p>
<p>to be so fond of in the days of our carefree first journey; oh, how</p>
<p>different things were now! I am not referring to Trapp or Trapps. After</p>
<p>all&#x2013;well, really . . . After all, gentlemen, it was becoming abundantly</p>
<p>clear that all those identical detectives in prismatically changing cars</p>
<p>were figments of my persecution mania, recurrent images based on coincidence</p>
<p>and chance resemblance. Soyons logiques, crowed the cocky Gallic part</p>
<p>of my brain&#x2013;and proceeded to rout the notion of a Lolita-maddened salesman</p>
<p>or comedy gangster, with stooges, persecuting me, and hoaxing me, and</p>
<p>otherwise taking riotous advantage of my strange relations with the law. I</p>
<p>remember humming my panic away. I remember evolving even an explanation of</p>
<p>the &#x201C;Birdsley&#x201D; telephone call . . . But if I could dismiss Trapp, as I had</p>
<p>dismissed my convulsions on the lawn at Champion, I could do nothing with</p>
<p>the anguish of knowing Lolita to be so tantalizingly, so miserably</p>
<p>unattainable and beloved on the very even of a new era, when my alembics</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (171 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>told me she should stop being a nymphet, stop torturing me.</p>
<p> An additional, abominable, and perfectly gratuitous worry was lovingly</p>
<p>prepared for me in Elphinstone. Lo had been dull and silent during the last</p>
<p>lap&#x2013;two hundred mountainous miles uncontaminated by smoke-gray sleuths or</p>
<p>zigzagging zanies. She hardly glanced at the famous, oddly shaped,</p>
<p>splendidly flushed rock which jutted above the mountains and had been the</p>
<p>take-off for nirvana on the part of a temperamental show girl. The town was</p>
<p>newly built, or rebuilt, on the flat floor of a seven-thousand-foot-high</p>
<p>valley; it would soon bore Lo, I hoped, and we would spin on to California,</p>
<p>to the Mexican border, to mythical bays, saguaro desserts, fatamorganas.</p>
<p>Jos&#xE8; Lizzarrabengoa, as you remember, planned to take his Carmen to the</p>
<p>Etats Unis. I conjured up a Central American tennis competition in</p>
<p>which Dolores Haze and various Californian schoolgirl champions would</p>
<p>dazzlingly participate. Good-will tours on that smiling level eliminate the</p>
<p>distinction between passport and sport. Why did I hope we would be happy</p>
<p>abroad? A change of environment is the traditional fallacy upon which doomed</p>
<p>loves, and lungs, rely.</p>
<p> Mrs. Hays, the brisk, briskly rouged, blue-eyed widow who ran the motor</p>
<p>court, asked me if I were Swiss perchance, because her sister had married a</p>
<p>Swiss ski instructor. I was, whereas my daughter happened to be half Irish.</p>
<p>I registered, Hays gave me the key and a tinkling smile, and, still</p>
<p>twinkling, showed me where to park the car; Lo crawled out and shivered a</p>
<p>little: the luminous evening air was decidedly crisp. Upon entering the</p>
<p>cabin, she sat down on a chair at a card table, buried her face in the crook</p>
<p>of her arm and said she felt awful. Shamming, I thought, shamming, no doubt,</p>
<p>to evade my caresses; I was passionately parched; but she began to whimper</p>
<p>in an unusually dreary way when I attempted to fondle her. Lolita ill.</p>
<p>Lolita dying. Her skin was scalding hot! I took her temperature, orally,</p>
<p>then looked up a scribbled formula I fortunately had in a jotter and after</p>
<p>laboriously reducing the, meaningless to me, degrees Fahrenheit to the</p>
<p>intimate centigrade of my childhood, found she had 40.4, which at least made</p>
<p>sense. Hysterical little nymphs might, I knew, run up all kinds of</p>
<p>temperature&#x2013;even exceeding a fatal count. And I would have given her a sip</p>
<p>of hot spiced wine, and two aspirins, and kissed the fever away, if, upon an</p>
<p>examination of her lovely uvula, one of the gems of her body, I had not seen</p>
<p>that it was a burning red. I undressed her. Her breath was bittersweet. Her</p>
<p>brown rose tasted of blood. She was shaking from head to toe. She complained</p>
<p>of a painful stiffness in the upper vertebrae&#x2013;and I thought of</p>
<p>poliomyelitis as any American parent would. Giving up all hope of</p>
<p>intercourse, I wrapped her in a laprobe and carried her into the car. Kind</p>
<p>Mrs. Hays in the meantime had alerted the local doctor. &#x201C;You are lucky it</p>
<p>happened here,&#x201D; she said; for not only was Blue the best man in the</p>
<p>district, but the Elphinstone hospital was as modern as modern could be,</p>

<p>despite its limited capacity. With a heterosexual Erlk&#xE6;nig in pursuit,</p>
<p>thither I drove, half-blinded by a royal sunset on the lowland side and</p>
<p>guided by a little old woman, a portable witch, perhaps his daughter, whom</p>
<p>Mrs. Haus had lent me, and whom I was never to see again. Dr. Blue, whose</p>
<p>learning, no doubt, was infinitely inferior to his reputation, assured me it</p>
<p>was a virus infection, and when I alluded to her comparatively recent flu,</p>
<p>curtly said this was another bug, he had forty such cases on his hands; all</p>
<p>of which sounded like the &#x201C;ague&#x201D; of the ancients. I wondered if I should</p>
<p>mention, with a casual chuckle, that my fifteen-year-old daughter had had a</p>
<p>minor accident while climbing an awkward fence with her boy friend, but</p>
<p>knowing I was drunk, I decided to withhold the information till later if</p>
<p>necessary. To an unsmiling blond bitch of a secretary I gave my daughter&#x2019;s</p>
<p>age as &#x201C;practically sixteen.&#x201D; While I was not looking, my child was taken</p>
<p>away from me! In vain I insisted I be allowed to spend the night on a</p>
<p>&#x201C;welcome&#x201D; mat in a corner of their damned hospital. I ran up</p>
<p>constructivistic flights of stairs, I tried to trace my darling so as to</p>
<p>tell her she had better not babble, especially if she felt as lightheaded as</p>
<p>we all did. At one point, I was rather dreadfully rude to a very young and</p>
<p>very cheeky nurse with overdeveloped gluteal parts and blazing black</p>
<p>eyes&#x2013;of Basque descent, as I learned. Her father was an imported shepherd,</p>
<p>a trainer of sheep dogs. Finally, I returned to the car and remained in it</p>
<p>for I do not know how many hours, hunched up in the dark, stunned by my new</p>
<p>solitude, looking out open-mouthed now at the dimly illumined, very square</p>
<p>and low hospital building squatting in the middle of its lawny block, now up</p>
<p>at the wash of stars and the jagged silvery ramparts of the haute</p>
<p>montagne where at the moment Mary&#x2019;s father, lonely Joseph Lore was</p>
<p>dreaming of Oloron, Lagore, Rolas&#x2013;que sais-je!&#x2013;or seducing a ewe.</p>
<p>Such-like fragrant vagabond thoughts have been always a solace to me in</p>
<p>times of unusual stress, and only when, despite liberal libations, I felt</p>
<p>fairly numbed by the endless night, did I think of driving back to the</p>
<p>motel. The old woman had disappeared, and I was not quite sure of my way.</p>
<p>Wide gravel roads criss-crossed drowsy rectangular shadows. I made out what</p>
<p>looked like the silhouette of gallows on what was probably a school</p>
<p>playground; and in another wastelike black there rose in domed silence the</p>
<p>pale temple of some local sect. I found the highway at last, and then the</p>
<p>motel, where millions of so-called &#x201C;millers,&#x201D; a kind of insect, were</p>
<p>swarming around the neon contours of &#x201C;No Vacancy&#x201D;; and, when, at 3 a.m.,</p>
<p>after one of those untimely hot showers which like some mordant only help to</p>
<p>fix a man&#x2019;s despair and weariness, I lay on her bed that smelled of</p>
<p>chestnuts and roses, and peppermint, and the very delicate, very special</p>
<p>French perfume I latterly allowed her to use, I found myself unable to</p>
<p>assimilate the simple fact that for the first time in two years I was</p>
<p>separated from my Lolita. All at once it occurred to me that her illness was</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (173 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>somehow the development of a theme&#x2013;that it had the same taste and tone as</p>
<p>the series of linked impressions which had puzzled and tormented me during</p>
<p>our journey; I imagined that secret agent, or secret lover, or prankster, or</p>
<p>hallucination, or whatever he was, prowling around the hospital&#x2013;and Aurora</p>
<p>had hardly &#x201C;warmed her hands,&#x201D; as the pickers of lavender way in the country</p>
<p>of my birth, when I found myself trying to get into that dungeon again,</p>
<p>knocking upon its green doors, breakfastless, stool-less, in despair.</p>
<p> This was Tuesday, and Wednesday or Thursday, splendidly reacting like</p>
<p>the darling she was to some &#x201C;serum&#x201D; (sparrow&#x2019;s sperm or dugong&#x2019;s dung), she</p>
<p>was much better, and the doctor said that in a couple of days she would be</p>
<p>&#x201C;skipping&#x201D; again.</p>
<p> Of the eight times I visited her, the last one alone remains sharply</p>
<p>engraved on my mind. It had been a great feat to come for I felt all</p>
<p>hollowed out by the infection that by then was at work on me too. None will</p>
<p>know the strain it was to carry that bouquet, that load of love, those books</p>
<p>that I had traveled sixty miles to buy: Browning&#x2019;s Dramatic Works, The</p>
<p>history of Dancing, Clowns and Columbines, The Russian Ballet, Flowers of</p>
<p>the Rockies, the Theatre Guild Anthology, Tennis by Helen Wills, who had</p>
<p>won the National Junior Girl Singles at the age of fifteen. As I was</p>
<p>staggering up to the door of my daughter&#x2019;s thirteen-dollar-a day private</p>
<p>room, Mary Lore, the beastly young part-time nurse who had taken an</p>
<p>unconcealed dislike to me, emerged with a finished breakfast tray, placed it</p>
<p>with a quick crash on a chair in the corridor, and, fundament jigging, shot</p>
<p>back into the room&#x2013;probably to warn her poor little Dolores that the</p>
<p>tyrannical old father was creeping up on crepe soles, with books and</p>
<p>bouquet: the latter I had composed of wild flowers and beautiful leaves</p>
<p>gathered with my own gloved hands on a mountain pass at sunrise (I hardly</p>
<p>slept at all that fateful week).</p>
<p> Feeding my Carmencita well? Idly I glanced at the tray. On a</p>
<p>yolk-stained plate there was a crumpled envelope. It had contained</p>
<p>something, since one edge was torn, but there was no address on it&#x2013;nothing</p>
<p>at all, save a phony armorial design with &#x201C;Ponderosa Lodge&#x201D; in green</p>
<p>letters; thereupon I performed a chass&#xE8;-crois&#xE8; with Mary, who was in</p>
<p>the act of bustling out again&#x2013;wonderful how fast they move and how little</p>
<p>they do, those rumpy young nurses. She glowered at the envelope I had put</p>
<p>back, uncrumpled.</p>
<p> &#x201C;You better not touch,&#x201D; she said, nodding directionally. &#x201C;Could burn</p>
<p>your fingers.&#x201D;</p>
<p> Below my dignity to rejoin. All I said was:</p>
<p> &#x201C;Je croyais que c&#x2019;&#xE8;tait un bill&#x2013;not a billet doux.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Then, entering the sunny room, to Lolita: &#x201C;Bonjour, mon petit.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Dolores,&#x201D; said Mary Lore, entering with me, past me, though me, the</p>
<p>plump whore, and blinking, and starting to fold very rapidly a white flannel</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (174 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>blanket as she blinked: &#x201C;Dolores, your pappy thinks you are getting letters</p>
<p>from my boy friend. It&#x2019;s me (smugly tapping herself on the small gilt cross</p>
<p>she wore) gets them. And my pappy can parlay-voo as well as yours.&#x201D;</p>
<p> She left the room. Dolores, so rosy and russet, lips freshly painted,</p>
<p>hair brilliantly brushed, bare arms straightened out on neat coverleat, lay</p>
<p>innocently beaming at me or nothing. On the bed table, next to a paper</p>
<p>napkin and a pencil, her topaz ring burned in the sun.</p>
<p> &#x201C;what gruesome funeral flowers,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;Thanks all the same. But do</p>
<p>you mind very much cutting out the French? It annoys everybody.&#x201D;</p>
<p> Back at the usual rush came the ripe young hussy, reeking of urine and</p>
<p>garlic, with the Desert News, which her fair patient eagerly</p>
<p>accepted, ignoring the sumptuously illustrated volumes I had brought.</p>
<p> &#x201C;My sister Ann,&#x201D; said Marry (topping information with afterthought),</p>
<p>&#x201C;works at the Ponderosa place.&#x201D;</p>
<p> Poor Bluebeard. Those brutal brothers. Est-ce que tu ne m&#x2019;aimes</p>
<p>plus, ma Carmen? She never had. At the moment I knew my love was as</p>
<p>hopeless as ever&#x2013;and I also knew the two girls were conspirators, plotting</p>
<p>in Basque, or Zemfirian, against my hopeless love. I shall go further and</p>
<p>say that Lo was playing a double game since she was also fooling sentimental</p>
<p>Mary whom she had told, I suppose, that she wanted to dwell with her</p>
<p>fun-loving young uncle and not with cruel melancholy me. And another nurse</p>
<p>whom I never identified, and the village idiot who carted cots and coffins</p>
<p>into the elevator, and the idiotic green love birds in a cage in the waiting</p>
<p>room&#x2013;all were in the plot, the sordid plot. I suppose Mary thought comedy</p>
<p>father Professor Humbertoldi was interfering with the romance between</p>
<p>Dolores and her father-substitute, roly-poly Romeo (for you were</p>
<p>rather lardy, you know, Rom, despite all that &#x201C;snow&#x201D; and &#x201C;joy juice&#x201D;).</p>
<p> My throat hurt. I stood, swallowing, at the window and stared at the</p>
<p>mountains, at the romantic rock high up in the smiling plotting sky.</p>
<p> &#x201C;My Carmen,&#x201D; I said (I used to call her that sometimes), &#x201C;we shall</p>
<p>leave this raw sore town as soon as you get out of bed.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Incidentally, I want all my clothes,&#x201D; said the gitanilla, humping up</p>
<p>her knees and turning to another page.</p>
<p> &#x201C;. . . Because, really,&#x201D; I continued, &#x201C;there is no point in staying</p>
<p>here.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;There is no point in staying anywhere,&#x201D; said Lolita.</p>
<p> I lowered myself into a cretonne chair and, opening the attractive</p>
<p>botanical work, attempted, in the fever-humming hush of the room, to</p>
<p>identify my flowers. This proved impossible. Presently a musical bell softly</p>
<p>sounded somewhere in the passage.</p>
<p> I do not think they had more than a dozen patients (three or four were</p>
<p>lunatics, as Lo had cheerfully informed me earlier) in that show place of a</p>
<p>hospital, and the staff had too much leisure. However&#x2013;likewise for reasons</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (175 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>of show&#x2013;regulations were rigid. It is also true that I kept coming at the</p>
<p>wrong hours. Not without a secret flow of dreamy malice, visionary</p>
<p>Mary (next time it will be une belle dame toute en bleu floating</p>
<p>through Roaring Gulch) plucked me by the sleeve to lead me out. I looked at</p>
<p>her hand; it dropped. As I was leaving, leaving voluntarily, Dolores Haze</p>
<p>reminded me to bring her next morning . . . She did not remember where the</p>
<p>various things she wanted were . . . &#x201C;Bring me,&#x201D; she cried (out of sight</p>
<p>already, door on the move, closing, closed), &#x201C;the new gray suitcase and</p>
<p>Mother&#x2019;s trunk&#x201D;; but by next morning I was shivering, and boozing, and dying</p>
<p>nit he motel bed she had used for just a few minutes, and the best I could</p>
<p>do under the circular and dilating circumstances was to send the two bags</p>
<p>over with the widow&#x2019;s beau, a robust and kindly trucker. I imagined Lo</p>
<p>displaying her treasures to Mary . . . No doubt, I was a little</p>
<p>delirious&#x2013;and on the following day I was still a vibration rather than a</p>
<p>solid, for when I looked out the bathroom window at the adjacent lawn, I saw</p>
<p>Dolly&#x2019;s beautiful young bicycle propped up there on its support, the</p>
<p>graceful front wheel looking away from me, as it always did, and a sparrow</p>
<p>perched on the saddle&#x2013;but it was the landlady&#x2019;s bike, and smiling a little,</p>
<p>and shaking my poor head over my fond fancies, I tottered back to my bed,</p>
<p>and lay as quiet as a saint&#x2013;</p>
<p> Saint, forsooth! While brown Dolores,</p>
<p> On a patch of sunny green</p>
<p> With Sanchicha reading stories</p>
<p> In a movie magazine&#x2013;</p>
<p> &#x2013;which was represented by numerous specimens wherever Dolores landed,</p>
<p>and there was some great national celebration in town judging by the</p>
<p>firecrackers, veritable bombs, that exploded all the time, and at five</p>
<p>minutes to two p.m. I heard the sound of whistling lips nearing the</p>
<p>half-opened door of my cabin, and then a thump upon it.</p>
<p> It was big Frank. He remained framed in the opened door, one hand on</p>
<p>its jamb, leaning forward a little.</p>
<p> Howdy. Nurse Lore was on the telephone. She wanted to know was I better</p>
<p>and would I come today?</p>
<p> At twenty paces Frank used to look a mountain of health; at five, as</p>
<p>now, he was a ruddy mosaic of scars&#x2013;had been blown through a wall overseas;</p>
<p>but despite nameless injuries he was able to man a tremendous truck, fish,</p>
<p>hunt, drink, and buoyantly dally with roadside ladies. That day, either</p>
<p>because it was such a great holiday, or simply because he wanted to divert a</p>
<p>sick man, he had taken off the glove he usually wore on his left hand (the</p>
<p>one pressing against the side of the door) and revealed to the fascinated</p>
<p>sufferer not only an entire lack of fourth and fifth fingers, but also a</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (176 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>naked girl, with cinnabar nipples and indigo delta, charmingly tattooed on</p>
<p>the back of his crippled hand, its index and middle digit making her legs</p>
<p>while his wrist bore her flower-crowned head. Oh, delicious . . . reclining</p>
<p>against the woodwork, like some sly fairy.</p>
<p> I asked him to tell Mary Lore I would stay in bed all day and would get</p>
<p>into touch with my daughter sometime tomorrow if I felt probably Polynesian.</p>
<p> He noticed the direction of my gaze and made her right hip twitch</p>
<p>amorously.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Okey-dokey,&#x201D; big Frank sang out, slapped the jamb, and whistling,</p>
<p>carried my message away, and I went on drinking, and by morning the fever</p>
<p>was gone, and although I was as limp as a toad, I put on the purple dressing</p>
<p>gown over my maize yellow pajamas, and walked over to the office telephone.</p>
<p>Everything was fine. A bright voice informed me that yes, everything was</p>
<p>fine, my daughter had checked out the day before, around two, her uncle, Mr.</p>
<p>Gustave, had called for her with a cocker spaniel pup and a smile for</p>
<p>everyone, and a black Caddy Lack, and had paid Dolly&#x2019;s bill in cash, and</p>
<p>told them to tell me I should not worry, and keep warm, they were at</p>
<p>Grandpa&#x2019;s ranch as agreed.</p>
<p> Elphinstone was, and I hope still is, a very cute little town. It was</p>
<p>spread like a maquette, you know, with its neat greenwool trees and</p>
<p>red-roofed houses over the valley floor and I think I have alluded earlier</p>
<p>to its model school and temple and spacious rectangular blocks, some of</p>
<p>which were, curiously enough, just unconventional pastures with a mule or a</p>
<p>unicorn grazing in the young July morning mist. Very amusing: at one</p>
<p>gravel&#x2013;groaning sharp turn I sideswiped a parked car but said to myself</p>
<p>telestically&#x2013;and, telepathically (I hoped), to its gesticulating</p>
<p>owner&#x2013;that I would return later, address Bird School, Bird, New Bird, the</p>
<p>gin kept my heart alive but bemazed my brain, and after some lapses and</p>
<p>losses common to dream sequences, I found myself in the reception room,</p>
<p>trying to beat up the doctor, and roaring at people under chairs, and</p>
<p>clamoring for Mary who luckily for her was not there; rough hands plucked at</p>
<p>my dressing gown, ripping off a pocket, and somehow I seem to have been</p>
<p>sitting on a bald brown-headed patient, whom I had mistaken for Dr. Blue,</p>
<p>and who eventually stood up, remarking with a preposterous accent: &#x201C;Now, who</p>
<p>is nevrotic, I ask?&#x201D;&#x2013;and then a gaunt unsmiling nurse presented me with</p>
<p>seven beautiful, beautiful books and the exquisitely folded tartan</p>
<p>lap robe, and demanded a receipt; and in the sudden silence I became aware</p>
<p>of a policeman in the hallway, to whom my fellow motorist was pointing me</p>
<p>out, and meekly I signed the very symbolic receipt, thus surrendering my</p>
<p>Lolita to all those apes. But what else could I do? One simple and stark</p>
<p>thought stood out and this was: &#x201C;Freedom for the moment is everything.&#x201D; One</p>
<p>false move&#x2013;and I might have been made to explain a life of crime. So I</p>
<p>simulated a coming out of a daze. To my fellow motorist I paid what he</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (177 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>thought was fair. To Dr. Blue, who by then was stroking my hand, I spoke in</p>
<p>tears of the liquor I bolstered too freely a tricky but not necessarily</p>
<p>diseased heart with. To the hospital in general I apologized with a flourish</p>
<p>that almost bowled me over, adding however that I was not on particularly</p>
<p>good terms with the rest of the Humbert clan. To myself I whispered that I</p>
<p>still had my gun, and was still a free man&#x2013;free to trace the fugitive, free</p>
<p>to destroy my brother.</p>
<p> 23</p>
<p> A thousand-mile stretch of silk-smooth road separated Kasbeam, where,</p>
<p>to the best of my belief, the red fiend had been scheduled to appear for the</p>
<p>first time, and fateful Elphinstone which we had reached about a week before</p>
<p>Independence Day. The journey had taken up most of June for we had seldom</p>
<p>made more than a hundred and fifty miles per traveling day, spending the</p>
<p>rest of the time, up to five days in one case, at various stopping places,</p>
<p>all of them also prearranged, no doubt. It was that stretch, then, along</p>
<p>which the fiend&#x2019;s spoor should be sought; and to this I devoted myself,</p>
<p>after several unmentionable days of dashing up and down the relentlessly</p>
<p>radiating roads in the vicinity of Elphinstone.</p>
<p> Imagine me, reader , with my shyness, my distaste for any ostentation,</p>
<p>my inherent sense of the comme il faut, imagine me masking the frenzy</p>
<p>of my grief with a trembling ingratiating smile while devising some casual</p>
<p>pretext to flip through the hotel register: &#x201C;Oh,&#x201D; I would say, &#x201C;I am almost</p>
<p>positive that I stayed here once&#x2013;let me look up the entries for</p>
<p>mid-June&#x2013;no, I see I&#x2019;m wrong after all&#x2013;what a very quaint name for a home</p>
<p>town, Kawtagain. Thanks very much.&#x201D; Or: &#x201C;I had a customer staying here&#x2013;I</p>
<p>mislaid his address&#x2013;may I . . .?&#x201D; And every once in a while, especially if</p>
<p>the operator of the place happened to be a certain type of gloomy male,</p>
<p>personal inspection of the books was denied me.</p>
<p> I have a memo here: between July 5 and November 18, when I returned to</p>
<p>Beardsley for a few days, I registered, if not actually stayed, at 342</p>
<p>hotels, motels and tourist homes. This figure includes a few registrations</p>
<p>between Chestnut and Beardsley, one of which yielded a shadow of the fiend</p>
<p>(&#x201C;N. Petit, Larousse, Ill.&#x201D;); I had to space and time my inquiries carefully</p>
<p>so as not to attract undue attention; and there must have been at least</p>
<p>fifty places where I merely inquired at the desk&#x2013;but that was a futile</p>
<p>quest, and I preferred building up a foundation of verisimilitude and good</p>
<p>will by first paying for an unneeded room. My survey showed that of the 300</p>
<p>or so books inspected, at least 20 provided me with a clue: the loitering</p>
<p>fiend had stopped even more often than we, or else&#x2013;he was quite capable of</p>
<p>that&#x2013;he had thrown in additional registrations in order to keep me well</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (178 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>furnished with derisive hints. Only in one case had he actually stayed at</p>
<p>the same motor court as we, a few paces from Lolita&#x2019;s pillow. In some</p>
<p>instances he had taken up quarters in the same or in a neighboring block;</p>
<p>not infrequently he had lain in wait at an intermediate spot between two</p>
<p>bespoken points. How vividly I recalled Lolita, just before our departure</p>
<p>from Beardsley, prone on the parlor rug, studying tour books and maps, and</p>
<p>marking laps and stops with her lipstick!</p>
<p> I discovered at once that he had foreseen my investigations and had</p>
<p>planted insulting pseudonyms for my special benefit. At the very first motel</p>
<p>office I visited, Ponderosa Lodge, his entry, among a dozen obviously human</p>
<p>ones, read: Dr. Gratiano Forbeson, Mirandola, NY. Its Italian Comedy</p>
<p>connotations could not fail to strike me, of course. The landlady deigned to</p>
<p>inform me that the gentleman had been laid up for five days with a bad cold,</p>
<p>that he had left his car for repairs in some garage or other and that he had</p>
<p>checked out on the 4th of July. Yes, a girl called Ann Lore had worked</p>
<p>formerly at the Lodge, but was now married to a grocer in Cedar City. One</p>
<p>moonlit night I waylaid white-shoed Mary on a solitary street; an automaton,</p>
<p>she was about to shriek, but I managed to humanize her by the simple act of</p>
<p>falling on my knees and with pious yelps imploring her to help. She did not</p>
<p>know a thing, she swore. Who was this Gratiano Forbeson? She seemed to</p>
<p>waver. I whipped out a hundred-dollar bill. She lifted it to the light of</p>
<p>the moon. &#x201C;He is your brother,&#x201D; she whispered at last. I plucked the bill</p>
<p>out of her moon-cold hand, and spitting out a French curse turned and ran</p>
<p>away. This taught me to rely on myself alone. No detective could discover</p>
<p>the clues Trapp had tuned to my mind and manner. I could not hope, of</p>
<p>course, he would ever leave his correct name and address; but I did hope he</p>
<p>might slip on the glaze of his own subtlety, by daring, say, to introduce a</p>
<p>richer and more personal shot of color than strictly necessary, or by</p>
<p>revealing too much through a qualitative sum of quantitative parts which</p>
<p>revealed too little. In one thing he succeeded: he succeeded in thoroughly</p>
<p>enmeshing me and my thrashing anguish in his demoniacal game. With infinite</p>
<p>skill, he swayed and staggered, and regained an impossible balance, always</p>
<p>leaving me with the sportive hope&#x2013;if I may use such a term in speaking of</p>
<p>betrayal, fury, desolation, horror and hate&#x2013;that he might give himself away</p>
<p>next time. He never did&#x2013;though coming damn close to it. We all admire the</p>
<p>spangled acrobat with classical grace meticulously walking his tight rope in</p>
<p>the talcum light; but how much rarer art there is in the sagging rope expert</p>
<p>wearing scarecrow clothes and impersonating a grotesque drunk! I</p>
<p>should know.</p>
<p> The clues he left did not establish his identity but they reflected his</p>
<p>personality, or at least a certain homogenous and striking personality; his</p>
<p>genre, his type of humor&#x2013;at its best at leat&#x2013;the tone of his brain, had</p>
<p>affinities with my own. He mimed and mocked me. His allusions were</p>

<p>definitely highbrow. He was well-read. He knew French. he was versed in</p>
<p>logodaedaly and logomancy. He was an amateur of sex lore. He had a feminine</p>
<p>handwriting. He would change his name but he could not disguise, no matter</p>
<p>how he slanted them, his very peculiar t&#x2019;s, w&#x2019;s and l&#x2019;s. Quelquepart Island</p>
<p>was one of his favorite residences. He did not use a fountain pen which</p>
<p>fact, as any psychoanalyst will tell you, meant that the patient was a</p>
<p>repressed undinist. One mercifully hopes there are water nymphs in the Styx.</p>
<p> His main trait was his passion for tantalization. Goodness, what a</p>
<p>tease the poor fellow was! He challenged my scholarship. I am sufficiently</p>
<p>proud of my knowing something to be modest about my not knowing all; and I</p>
<p>daresay I missed some elements in that cryprogrammic paper chase. What a</p>
<p>shiver of triumph and loathing shook my frail frame when, among the plain</p>
<p>innocent names in the hotel recorder, his fiendish conundrum would ejaculate</p>
<p>in my face! I noticed that whenever he felt his enigmas were becoming too</p>
<p>recondite, even for such a solver as I, he would lure me back with an easy</p>
<p>one. &#x201C;Ars&#xF5;ne Lupin&#x201D; was obvious to a Frenchman who remembered the detective</p>
<p>stories of his youth; and one hardly had to be a Coleridgian to appreciate</p>
<p>the trite poke of &#x201C;A. Person, Porlock, England.&#x201D; In horrible taste but</p>
<p>basically suggestive of a cultured man&#x2013;not a policeman, not a common good,</p>
<p>not a lewd salesman&#x2013;were such assumed names as &#x201C;Arthur Rainbow&#x201D;&#x2013;plainly</p>
<p>the travestied author of Le Bateau Bleu&#x2013;let me laugh a little too,</p>
<p>gentlemen&#x2013;and &#x201C;Morris Schmetterling,&#x201D; of L&#x2019;Oiseau Ivre fame</p>
<p>(touch&#xE8;, reader!). The silly but funny &#x201C;D. Orgon, Elmira, NY,&#x201D; was</p>
<p>from Moli&#xF5;re, of course, and because I had quite recently tried to interest</p>
<p>Lolita in a famous 18th-century play, I welcomed as an old friend &#x201C;Harry</p>
<p>Bumper, Sheridan, Wyo.&#x201D; An ordinary encyclopedia informed me who the</p>
<p>peculiar looking &#x201C;Phineas Quimby, Lebanon, NH&#x201D; was; and any good Freudian,</p>
<p>with a German name and some interest in religious prostitution, should</p>
<p>recognize at a glance the implication of &#x201C;Dr. Kitzler, Eryx, Miss.&#x201D; So far</p>
<p>so good. That sort of fun was shoddy but on the whole impersonal and thus</p>
<p>innocuous. Among entries that arrested my attention as undoubtable clues</p>
<p>per se but baffled me in respect to their finer points I do not care</p>
<p>to mention many since I feel I am groping in a border-land mist with verbal</p>
<p>phantoms turning, perhaps, into living vacationists. Who was &#x201C;Johnny</p>
<p>Randall, Ramble, Ohio&#x201D;? Or was he a real person who just happened to write a</p>
<p>hand similar to &#x201C;N.S. Aristoff, Catagela, NY&#x201D;? What was the sting in</p>
<p>&#x201C;Catagela&#x201D;? And what about &#x201C;James Mavor Morell, Hoaxton, England&#x201D;?</p>
<p>&#x201C;Aristophanes,&#x201D; &#x201C;hoax&#x201D;&#x2013;fine, but what was I missing?</p>
<p> There was one strain running through all that pseudonymity which caused</p>
<p>me especially painful palpitations when I came across it. Such things as &#x201C;G.</p>
<p>Trapp, Geneva, NY.&#x201D; was the sign of treachery on Lolita&#x2019;s part. &#x201C;Aubrey</p>
<p>Beardsley, Quelquepart Island&#x201D; suggested more lucidly than the garbled</p>
<p>telephone message had that the starting point of the affair should be looked</p>

<p>for in the East. &#x201C;Lucas Picador, Merrymay, Pa.&#x201D; insinuated that my Carmen</p>
<p>had betrayed my pathetic endearments to the impostor. Horribly cruel,</p>
<p>forsooth, was &#x201C;Will Brown, Dolores, Colo.&#x201D; The gruesome &#x201C;Harold Haze,</p>
<p>Tombstone, Arizona&#x201D; (which at another time would have appealed to my sense</p>
<p>of humor) implied a familiarity with the girl&#x2019;s past that in nightmare</p>
<p>fashion suggested for a moment that my quarry was an old friend of the</p>
<p>family, maybe an old flame of Charlotte&#x2019;s, maybe a redresser of wrongs</p>
<p>(&#x201C;Donald Quix, Sierra, Nev.&#x201D;). But the most penetrating bodkin was the</p>
<p>anagramtailed entry in the register of Chestnut Lodge &#x201C;Ted Hunter, Cane,</p>
<p>NH.&#x201D;</p>
<p> The garbled license numbers left by all these Persons and Orgons and</p>
<p>Morells and Trapps only told me that motel keepers omit to check if guests&#x2019;</p>
<p>cars are accurately listed. References&#x2013;incompletely or incorrectly</p>
<p>indicated&#x2013;to the cars the fiend had hired for short laps between Wace and</p>
<p>Elphinstone were of course useless; the license of the initial Aztec was a</p>
<p>shimmer of shifting numerals, some transposed, others altered or omitted,</p>
<p>but somehow forming interrelated combinations (such as &#x201C;WS 1564&#x201D; and &#x201C;SH</p>
<p>1616,&#x201D; and &#x201C;Q32888&#x201D; or &#x201C;CU88322&#x201D;) which however were so cunningly contrived</p>
<p>as to never reveal a common denominator.</p>
<p> It occurred to me that after he had turned that convertible over to</p>
<p>accomplices at Wace and switched to the stage-motor car system, his</p>
<p>successors might have been less careful and might have inscribed at some</p>
<p>hotel office the archtype of those interrelated figures. But if looking for</p>
<p>the fiend along a road I knew he had taken was such a complicated vague and</p>
<p>unprofitable business, what could I expect from any attempt to trace unknown</p>
<p>motorists traveling along unknown routes?</p>
<p> 24</p>
<p> By the time I reached Beardsley, in the course of the harrowing</p>
<p>recapitulation I have now discussed at sufficient length, a complete image</p>
<p>had formed in my mind; and through the&#x2013;always risky&#x2013;process of elimination</p>
<p>I had reduced this image to the only concrete source that morbid cerebration</p>
<p>and torpid memory could give it.</p>
<p> Except for the Rev. Rigor Mortis (as the girls called him), and an old</p>
<p>gentleman who taught non-obligatory German and Latin, there were no regular</p>
<p>male teachers t Beardsley School. But on two occasions an art instructor on</p>
<p>the Beardsley College faculty had come over to show the schoolgirls magic</p>
<p>lantern pictures of French castles and nineteenth-century paintings. I had</p>
<p>wanted to attend those projections and talks, but Dolly, as was her wont,</p>
<p>had asked me not to, period. I also remembered that Gaston had referred to</p>
<p>that particular lecturer as a brilliant gar&#xE3;on; but that was all;</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (181 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>memory refused to supply me with the name of the chateau-lover.</p>
<p> On the day fixed for the execution, I walked though the sleet across</p>
<p>the campus to the information desk in Maker Hall, Beardsley College. There I</p>
<p>learned that the fellow&#x2019;s name was Riggs (rather like that of the minister),</p>
<p>that he was a bachelor, and that in ten minutes he would issue from the</p>
<p>&#x201C;Museum&#x201D; where he was having a class. In the passage leading to the</p>
<p>auditorium I sat on a marble bench of sorts donated by Cecilia Dalrymple</p>
<p>Ramble. As I waited there, in the prostatic discomfort, drunk,</p>
<p>sleep-starved, with my gun in my fist in my raincoat pocket, it suddenly</p>
<p>occurred to me that I was demented and was about to do something stupid.</p>
<p>There was not one chance in a million that Albert Riggs, Ass. Prof., was</p>
<p>hiding my Lolita at his Beardsley home, 24 Pritchard Road. He could not be</p>
<p>the villain. It was absolutely preposterous. I was losing my time and my</p>
<p>wits. He and she were in California and not here at all.</p>
<p> Presently, I noticed a vague commotion behind some white statues; a</p>
<p>door-not the one I had been staring at&#x2013;opened briskly, and amid a bevy of</p>
<p>women students a baldish head and two bright brown eyes bobbed, advanced.</p>
<p> He was a total stranger to me but insisted we had met at a lawn party</p>
<p>at Beardsley School. How was my delightful tennis-playing daughter? He had</p>
<p>another class. He would be seeing me.</p>
<p> Another attempt at identification was less speedily resolved: through</p>
<p>an advertisement in one of Lo&#x2019;s magazines I dared to get in touch with a</p>
<p>private detective, an ex-pugilist, and merely to give him some idea of the</p>
<p>method adopted by the fiend, I acquainted him with the kind of names</p>
<p>and addresses I had collected. He demanded a goodish deposit and for two</p>
<p>years&#x2013;two years, reader!&#x2013;that imbecile busied himself with checking those</p>
<p>nonsense data. I had long severed all monetary relations with him when he</p>
<p>turned up one day with the triumphant information that an eighty-year-old</p>
<p>Indian by the name of Bill Brown lived near Dolores, Colo.</p>
<p> 25</p>
<p> This book is about Lolita; and now that I have reached the part which</p>
<p>(had I not been forestalled by another internal combustion martyr) might be</p>
<p>called &#x201C;Dolor&#xF5;s Disparue,&#x201D; there would be little sense in analyzing</p>
<p>the three empty years that followed. While a few pertinent points have to be</p>
<p>marked, the general impression I desire to convey is of a side door crashing</p>
<p>open in life&#x2019;s full flight, and a rush of roaring black time drowning with</p>
<p>its whipping wind the cry of lone disaster.</p>
<p> Singularly enough, I seldom if ever dreamed of Lolita as I remembered</p>
<p>her&#x2013;as I saw her constantly and obsessively in my conscious mind during my</p>
<p>daymares and insomnias. More precisely: she did haunt my sleep but she</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (182 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>appeared there in strange and ludicrous disguises as Valeria or Charlotte,</p>
<p>or a cross between them. That complex ghost would come to me, shedding shift</p>
<p>after shift, in an atmosphere of great melancholy and disgust, and would</p>
<p>recline in dull invitation on some narrow board or hard settee, with flesh</p>
<p>ajar like the rubber valve of a soccer ball&#x2019;s bladder. I would bind myself,</p>
<p>dentures fractured or hopelessly mislaid, in horrible chambres</p>
<p>garnies where I would be entertained at tedious vivisecting parties that</p>
<p>generally ended with Charlotte or Valeria weeping in my bleeding arms and</p>
<p>being tenderly kissed by my brotherly lips in a dream disorder of</p>
<p>auctioneered Viennese bric-&#xFE;-brac, pity, impotence and the brown wigs of</p>
<p>tragic old women who had just been gassed.</p>
<p> One day I removed from the car and destroyed an accumulation of</p>
<p>teen-magazines. You know the sort. Stone age at heart; up to date, or at</p>
<p>least Mycenaean, as to hygiene. A handsome, very ripe actress with huge</p>
<p>lashes and a pulpy red underlip, endorsing a shampoo. Ads and fads. Young</p>
<p>scholars dote on plenty of pleats&#x2013;que c&#x2019;&#xE8;tait loin, tout cela! It is</p>
<p>your hostess&#x2019; duty to provide robes. Unattached details take all the sparkle</p>
<p>out of your conversation. All of us have known &#x201C;pickers&#x201D;&#x2013;one who picks her</p>
<p>cuticle at the office party. Unless he is very elderly or very important, a</p>
<p>man should remove his gloves before shaking hands with a woman. Invite</p>
<p>Romance by wearing the Exciting New Tummy Flattener. Trims tums, nips hips.</p>
<p>Tristram in Movielove. Yessir! The Joe-Roe marital enigma is making yaps</p>
<p>flap. Glamorize yourself quickly and inexpensively. Comics. Bad girl dark</p>
<p>hair fat father cigar; good girl red hair handsome daddums clipped mustache.</p>
<p>Or that repulsive strip with the big gagoon and his wife, a kiddoid gnomide.</p>
<p>Et moi qui t&#x2019;offrais mon genie . . . I recalled the rather charming</p>
<p>nonsense verse I used to write her when she was a child: &#x201C;nonsense,&#x201D; she</p>
<p>used to say mockingly, &#x201C;is correct.&#x201D;</p>
<p> The Squirl and his Squirrel, the Rabs and their Rabbits</p>
<p> Have certain obscure and peculiar habits.</p>
<p> Male hummingbirds make the most exquisite rockets.</p>
<p> The snake when he walks holds his hands in his pockets. . .</p>
<p> Other things of hers were harder to relinquish. Up to the end of 1949,</p>
<p>I cherished and adored, and stained with my kisses and merman tears, a pair</p>
<p>of old sneakers, a boy&#x2019;s shirt she had worn, some ancient blue jeans I found</p>
<p>in the trunk compartment, a crumpled school cap, suchlike wanton treasures.</p>
<p>Then, when I understood my mind was cracking, I collected those sundry</p>
<p>belongings, added to them what had been stored in Beardsley&#x2013;a box of books,</p>
<p>her bicycle, old coats, galoshes&#x2013;and on her fifteenth birthday mailed</p>
<p>everything as an anonymous gift to a home for orphaned girls on a windy</p>
<p>lake, on the Canadian border.</p>

<p> It is just possible that had I gone to a strong hypnotist he might have</p>
<p>extracted from me and arrayed in a logical pattern certain chance memories</p>
<p>that I have threaded through my book with considerably more ostentation than</p>
<p>they present themselves with to my mind even now when I know what to seek in</p>
<p>the past. At the time I felt I was merely losing contact with reality; and</p>
<p>after spending the rest of the winter and most of the following spring in a</p>
<p>Quebec sanatorium where I had stayed before, I resolved first to settle some</p>
<p>affairs of mine in New York and then to proceed to California for a thorough</p>
<p>search there.</p>
<p> Here is something I composed in my retreat:</p>
<p> Wanted, wanted: Dolores Haze.</p>
<p> Hair: brown. Lips: scarlet.</p>
<p> Age: five thousand three hundred days.</p>
<p> Profession: none, or &#x201C;starlet.&#x201D;</p>
<p> Where are you hiding, Dolores Haze?</p>
<p> Why are you hiding, darling?</p>
<p> (I talk in a daze, I walk in a maze,</p>
<p> I cannot get out, said the starling).</p>
<p> Where are you riding, Dolores Haze?</p>
<p> What make is the magic carpet?</p>
<p> Is a Cream Cougar the present craze?</p>
<p> And where are you parked, my car pet?</p>
<p> Who is your hero, Dolores Haze?</p>
<p> Still one of those blue-caped star-men?</p>
<p> Oh the balmy days and the palmy bays,</p>
<p> And the cars, and the bars, my Carmen!</p>
<p> Oh Dolores, that juke-box hurts!</p>
<p> Are you still dancin&#x2019;, darlin&#x2019;?</p>
<p> (Both in worn levis, both in torn T-shirts,</p>
<p> And I, in my corner, snarlin&#x2019;).</p>
<p> Happy, happy is gnarled McFate</p>
<p> Touring the States with a child wife,</p>
<p> Plowing his Molly in every State</p>
<p> Among the protected wild life.</p>
<p> My Dolly, my folly! Her eyes were vair,</p>
<p> And never closed when I kissed her.</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (184 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p> Know an old perfume called Soleil Vert?</p>
<p> Are you from Paris, mister?</p>
<p> L&#x2019;autre soir un air froid d&#x2019;op&#xE8;ra m&#x2019;alita:</p>
<p> Son f&#xE8;l&#xE8;&#x2013;bien fol est qui s&#x2019;y fie!</p>
<p> Il neige, le d&#xE8;cor s&#x2019;&#xE8;croule, Lolita!</p>
<p> Lolita, qu&#x2019;ai-je fait de ta vie?</p>
<p> Dying, dying, Lolita Haze,</p>
<p> Of hate and remorse, I&#x2019;m dying.</p>
<p> And again my hairy fist I raise,</p>
<p> And again I hear you crying.</p>
<p> Officer, officer, there they go&#x2013;</p>
<p> In the rain, where that lighted store is!</p>
<p> And her socks are white, and I love her so,</p>
<p> And her name is Haze, Dolores.</p>
<p> Officer, officer, there they are&#x2013;</p>
<p> Dolores Haze and her lover!</p>
<p> Whip out your gun and follow that car.</p>
<p> Now tumble out, and take cover.</p>
<p> Wanted, wanted: Dolores Haze.</p>
<p> Her dream-gray gaze never flinches.</p>
<p> Ninety pounds is all she weighs</p>
<p> With a height of sixty inches.</p>
<p> My car is limping, Dolores Haze,</p>
<p> And the last long lap is the hardest,</p>
<p> And I shall be dumped where the weed decays,</p>
<p> And the rest is rust and stardust.</p>
<p> By psychoanalyzing this poem, I notice it is really a maniac&#x2019;s</p>
<p>masterpiece. The stark, stiff, lurid rhymes correspond very exactly to</p>
<p>certain perspectiveless and terrible landscapes and figures, and magnified</p>
<p>parts of landscapes and figures, as drawn by psychopaths in tests devised by</p>
<p>their astute trainers. I wrote many more poems. I immersed myself in the</p>
<p>poetry of others. But not for a second did I forget the load of revenge.</p>
<p> I would be a knave to say, and the reader a fool to believe, that the</p>
<p>shock of losing Lolita cured me of pederosis. My accursed nature could not</p>
<p>change, no matter how my love for her did. On playgrounds and beaches, my</p>
<p>sullen and stealthy eye, against my will, still sought out the flash of a</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (185 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>nymphet&#x2019;s limbs, the sly tokens of Lolita&#x2019;s handmaids and rosegirls. But one</p>
<p>essential vision in me had withered: never did I dwell now on possibilities</p>
<p>of bliss with a little maiden, specific or synthetic, in some out-of-the-way</p>
<p>place; never did my fancy sink its fangs into Lolita&#x2019;s sisters, far far</p>
<p>away, in the coves of evoked islands. That was all over, for the time</p>
<p>being at least. On the other hand, alas, two years of monstrous indulgence</p>
<p>had left me with certain habits of lust: I feared lest the void I lived in</p>
<p>might drive me to plunge into the freedom of sudden insanity when confronted</p>
<p>with a chance temptation in some lane between school and supper. Solitude</p>
<p>was corrupting me. I needed company and care. My heart was a hysterical</p>
<p>unreliable organ. This is how Rita enters the picture.</p>
<p> 26</p>
<p> She was twice Lolita&#x2019;s age and three quarters of mine: a very slight,</p>
<p>dark-haired, pale-skinned adult, weighing a hundred and five pounds, with</p>
<p>charmingly asymmetrical eyes, and angular, rapidly sketched profile, and a</p>
<p>most appealing ensellure to her supple back&#x2013;I think she had some</p>
<p>Spanish or Babylonian blood. I picked her up one depraved May evening</p>
<p>somewhere between Montreal and New York, or more narrowly, between</p>
<p>Toylestown and Blake, at a darkishly burning bar under the sign of the</p>
<p>Tigermoth, where she was amiably drunk: she insisted we had gone to school</p>
<p>together, and she placed her trembling little hand on my ape paw. My senses</p>
<p>were very slightly stirred but I decided to give her a try; I did&#x2013;and</p>
<p>adopted her as a constant companion. She was so kind, was Rita, such a good</p>
<p>sport, that I daresay she would have given herself to any pathetic creature</p>
<p>or fallacy, an old broken tree or a bereaved porcupine, out of sheer</p>
<p>chumminess and compassion.</p>
<p> When I first met her she had but recently divorced her third</p>
<p>husband&#x2013;and a little more recently had been abandoned by her seventh</p>
<p>cavalier servant&#x2013;the others, the mutables, were too numerous and</p>
<p>mobile to tabulate. Her brother was&#x2013;and no doubt still is&#x2013;a prominent,</p>
<p>pasty-faced, suspenders-and-painted-tie-wearing politician, mayor and</p>
<p>booster of his ball-playing, Bible-reading, grain-handling home town. For</p>
<p>the last eight years he had been paying his great little sister several</p>
<p>hundred dollars per month under the stringent condition that she would never</p>
<p>never enter great little Grainball City. She told me, with wails of wonder,</p>
<p>that for some God-damn reason every new boy friend of hers would first of</p>
<p>all take her Grainball-ward: it was a fatal attraction; and before she knew</p>
<p>what was what, she would find herself sucked into the lunar orbit of the</p>
<p>town, and would be following the flood-lit drive that encircled it&#x2013;&#x201D;going</p>
<p>round and round,&#x201D; as she phrased it, &#x201C;like a God-damn mulberry moth.&#x201D;</p>

<p> She had a natty little coup&#xE8;; and in it we traveled to California so as</p>
<p>to give my venerable vehicle a rest. her natural speed was ninety. Dear</p>
<p>Rita! We cruised together for two dim years, from summer 1950 to summer</p>
<p>1952, and she was the sweetest, simplest, gentles, dumbest Rita imaginable.</p>
<p>In comparison to her, Valechka was a Schlegel, and Charlotte a Hegel. There</p>
<p>is no earthly reason why I should dally with her in the margin of this</p>
<p>sinister memoir, but let me say (hi, Rita&#x2013;wherever you are, drunk or</p>
<p>hangoverish, Rita, hi!) that she was the most soothing, the most</p>
<p>comprehending companion that I ever had, and certainly saved me from the</p>
<p>madhouse. I told her I was trying to trace a girl and plug that girl&#x2019;s</p>
<p>bully. Rita solemnly approved of the plan&#x2013;and in the course of some</p>
<p>investigation she undertook on her own (without really knowing a thing),</p>
<p>around San Humbertino, got entangled with a pretty awful crook herself; I</p>
<p>had the devil of a time retrieving her&#x2013;used and bruised but still cocky.</p>
<p>Then one day she proposed playing Russian roulette with my sacred automatic;</p>
<p>I said you couldn&#x2019;t, it was not a revolver, and we struggled for it, until</p>
<p>at last it went off, touching off a very thin and very comical spurt of hot</p>
<p>water from the hole it made in the wall of the cabin room; I remember her</p>
<p>shrieks of laughter.</p>
<p> The oddly prepubescent curve of her back, her ricey skin, her slow</p>
<p>languorous columbine kisses kept me from mischief. It is not the artistic</p>
<p>aptitudes that are secondary sexual characters as some shams and shamans</p>
<p>have said; it is the other way around: sex is but the ancilla of art. One</p>
<p>rather mysterious spree that had interesting repercussions I must notice. I</p>
<p>had abandoned the search: the fiend was either in Tartary or burning away in</p>
<p>my cerebellum (the flames fanned by my fancy and grief) but certainly not</p>
<p>having Dolores Haze play champion tennis on the Pacific Coast. One</p>
<p>afternoon, on our way back East, in a hideous hotel, the kind where they</p>
<p>hold conventions and where labeled, fat, pink men stagger around, all first</p>
<p>names and business and booze&#x2013;dear Rita and I awoke to find a third in our</p>
<p>room, a blond, almost albino, young fellow with white eyelashes and large</p>
<p>transparent ears, whom neither Rita nor I recalled having ever seen in our</p>
<p>sad lives. Sweating in thick dirty underwear, and with old army boots on, he</p>
<p>lay snoring on the double bed beyond my chaste Rita. One of his front teeth</p>
<p>was gone, amber pustules grew on his forehead. Ritochka enveloped her</p>
<p>sinuous nudity in my raincoat&#x2013;the first thing at hand; I slipped on a pair</p>
<p>of candy-striped drawers; and we took stock of the situation. Five glasses</p>
<p>had been used, which in the way of clues, was an embarrassment of riches.</p>
<p>The door was not properly closed. A sweater and a pair of shapeless tan</p>
<p>pants lay on the floor. We shook their owner into miserable consciousness.</p>
<p>He was completely amnesic. In an accent that Rita recognized as pure</p>
<p>Brooklynese, he peevishly insinuated that somehow we had purloined his</p>
<p>(worthless) identity. We rushed him into his clothes and left him at the</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (187 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>nearest hospital, realizing on the way that somehow or other after forgotten</p>
<p>gyrations, we ewer in Grainball. Half a year later Rita wrote the doctor for</p>
<p>news. Jack Humbertson as he had been tastelessly dubbed was still isolated</p>
<p>from his personal past. Oh Mnemosyne, sweetest and most mischievous of</p>
<p>muses!</p>
<p> I would not have mentioned this incident had it not started a chain of</p>
<p>ideas that resulted in my publishing in the Cantrip Review an essay</p>
<p>on &#x201C;Mimir and Memory,&#x201D; in which I suggested among other things that seemed</p>
<p>original and important to that splendid review&#x2019;s benevolent readers, a</p>
<p>theory of perceptual time based on the circulation of the blood and</p>
<p>conceptually depending (to fill up this nutshell) on the mind&#x2019;s being</p>
<p>conscious not only of matter but also of its own self, thus crating a</p>
<p>continuous spanning of two points (the storable future and the stored past).</p>
<p>In result of this venture&#x2013;and in culmination of the impression made by my</p>
<p>previous travaux&#x2013;I was called from New York, where Rita and I were</p>
<p>living in a little flat with a view of gleaming children taking shower baths</p>
<p>far below in a fountainous arbor of Central Park, to Cantrip College, four</p>
<p>hundred miles away, for one year. I lodged there, in special apartments for</p>
<p>poets and philosophers, from September 1951 to June 1952, while Rita whom I</p>
<p>preferred not to display vegetated&#x2013;somewhat indecorously, I am afraid&#x2013;in a</p>
<p>roadside inn where I visited her twice a week. Then she vanished&#x2013;more</p>
<p>humanly than her predecessor had done: a month later I found her in the</p>
<p>local jail. She was tr&#xF5;s digne, had had her appendix removed, and</p>
<p>managed to convince me that the beautiful bluish furs she had been accused</p>
<p>of stealing from a Mrs. Roland MacCrum had really been a spontaneous, if</p>
<p>somewhat alcoholic, gift from Roland himself. I succeeded in getting her out</p>
<p>without appealing to her touchy brother, and soon afterwards we drove back</p>
<p>to Central Park West, by way of Briceland, where we had stopped for a few</p>
<p>hours the year before.</p>
<p> A curious urge to relive my stay there with Lolita had got hold of me.</p>
<p>I was entering a phase of existence where I had given up all hope of tracing</p>
<p>her kidnapper and her. I now attempted to fall back on old settings in order</p>
<p>to save what still could be saved in the way of souvenir, souvenir que me</p>
<p>veux-tu? Autumn was ringing in the air. To a post card requesting twin</p>
<p>beds Professor Hamburg got a prompt expression of regret in reply. They were</p>
<p>full up. They had one bathless basement room with four beds which they</p>
<p>thought I would not want. Their note paper was headed:</p>
<p> The Enchanted Hunters</p>
<p> Near Churches No Dogs</p>
<p> All legal beverages</p>
<p> I wondered if the last statement was true. All? Did they have for</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (188 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>instance sidewalk grenadine? I also wondered if a hunter, enchanted or</p>
<p>otherwise, would not need a pointer more than a pew, and with a spasm of</p>
<p>pain I recalled a scene worthy of a great artist: petite nymphe</p>
<p>accroupie; but that silky cocker spaniel had perhaps been a baptized</p>
<p>one. No&#x2013;I felt I could not endure the throes of revisiting that lobby.</p>
<p>There was a much better possibility of retrievable time elsewhere in soft,</p>
<p>rich-colored, autumnal Briceland. Leaving Rita in a bar, I made for the town</p>
<p>library. A twittering spinster was only too glad to help me disinter</p>
<p>mid-August 1947 from the bound Briceland Gazette, and presently, in a</p>
<p>secluded nook under a naked light, I was turning the enormous and fragile</p>
<p>pages of a coffin-black volume almost as big as Lolita.</p>
<p> Reader! Bruder! What a foolish Hamburg that Hamburg was! Since</p>
<p>his supersensitive system was loath to face the actual scene, he thought he</p>
<p>could at least enjoy a secret part of it&#x2013;which reminds one of the tenth or</p>
<p>twentieth soldier in the raping queue who throws the girl&#x2019;s black shawl over</p>
<p>her white face so as not to see those impossible eyes while taking his</p>
<p>military pleasure in the sad, sacked village. What I lusted to get</p>
<p>was the printed picture that had chanced to absorb my trespassing image</p>
<p>while the Gazette&#x2019;s photographer was concentrating on Dr. Braddock</p>
<p>and his group. Passionately I hoped to find preserved the portrait of the</p>
<p>artist as a younger brute. An innocent camera catching me on my dark way to</p>
<p>Lolita&#x2019;s bed&#x2013;what a magnet for Mnemosyne! I cannot well explain the true</p>
<p>nature of that urge of mine. It was allied, I suppose, to that swooning</p>
<p>curiosity which impels one to examine with a magnifying glass bleak little</p>
<p>figures&#x2013;still life practically, and everybody about to throw up&#x2013;at an</p>
<p>early morning execution, and the patient&#x2019;s expression impossible to make out</p>
<p>in the print. Anyway, I was literally gasping for breath, and one corner of</p>
<p>the book of doom kept stabbing me in the stomach while I scanned and skimmed</p>
<p>. . . Brute Force and Possessed were coming on Sunday, the</p>
<p>24th, to both theatres. Mr. Purdom, independent tobacco auctioneer, said</p>
<p>that ever since 1925 he had been an Omen Faustum smoker. Husky Hank and his</p>
<p>petite bride were to be the guests of Mr. and Mrs. Reginald G. Gore, 58</p>
<p>Inchkeith Ave. The size of certain parasites is one sixth of the host.</p>
<p>Dunkerque was fortified in the tenth century. Misses&#x2019; socks, 39 c. Saddle</p>
<p>Oxfords 3.98. Wine, wine, wine, quipped the author of Dark Age who</p>
<p>refused to be photographed, may suit a Persian bubble bird, but I say give</p>
<p>me rain, rain, rain on the shingle roof for roses and inspiration every</p>
<p>time. Dimples are caused by the adherence of the skin to the deeper tissues.</p>
<p>Greeks repulse a heavy guerrilla assault&#x2013;and, ah, at last, a little figure</p>
<p>in white, and Dr. Braddock in black, but whatever spectral shoulder was</p>
<p>brushing against his ample form&#x2013;nothing of myself could I make out.</p>
<p> I went to find Rita who introduced me with her vin triste smile</p>
<p>to a pocket-sized wizened truculently tight old man saying this was&#x2013;what</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (189 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>was the name again, son?&#x2013;a former schoolmate of hers. He tried to retain</p>
<p>her, and in the slight scuffle that followed I hurt my thumb against his</p>
<p>hard head. In the silent painted part where I walked her and aired her a</p>
<p>little, she sobbed and said I would soon, soon leave her as everybody had,</p>
<p>and I sang her a wistful French ballad, and strung together some fugitive</p>
<p>rhymes to amuse her:</p>
<p> The place was called Enchanted Hunters. Query:</p>
<p> What Indian dyes, Diana, did thy dell</p>
<p> endorses to make of Picture Lake a very</p>
<p> blood bath of trees before the blue hotel?</p>
<p> She said: &#x201C;Why blue when it is white, why blue for heaven&#x2019;s sake?&#x201D; and</p>
<p>started to cry again, and I marched her to the car, and we drove on to New</p>
<p>York, and soon she was reasonably happy again high up in the haze on the</p>
<p>little terrace of our flat. I notice I have somehow mixed up two events, my</p>
<p>visit with Rita to Briceland on our way to Carntrip, and our passing through</p>
<p>Briceland again on our way back to New York, but such suffusions of swimming</p>
<p>colors are not to be disdained by the artist in recollection.</p>
<p> 27</p>
<p> My letterbox in the entrance hall belonged to the type that allows one</p>
<p>to glimpse something of its contents through a glassed slit. Several times</p>
<p>already, a trick of harlequin light that fell through the glass upon an</p>
<p>alien handwriting had twisted it into a semblance of Lolita&#x2019;s script causing</p>
<p>me almost to collapse as I leant against an adjacent urn, almost my own.</p>
<p>Whenever that happened&#x2013;whenever her lovely, childish scrawl was horribly</p>
<p>transformed into the dull hand of one of my few correspondents&#x2013;I used to</p>
<p>recollect, with anguished amusement, the times in my trustful, pre-dolorian</p>
<p>past when I would be misled by a jewel-bright window opposite wherein my</p>
<p>lurking eye, the ever alert periscope of my shameful vice, would make out</p>
<p>from afar a half-naked nymphet stilled in the act of combing her</p>
<p>Alice-in-Wonderland hair. There was in the fiery phantasm a perfection which</p>
<p>made my wild delight also perfect, just because the vision was out of reach,</p>
<p>with no possibility of attainment to spoil it by the awareness of an</p>
<p>appended taboo; indeed, it may well be that the very attraction immaturity</p>
<p>has for me lies not so much in the limpidity of pure young forbidden fairy</p>
<p>child beauty as in the security of a situation where infinite perfections</p>
<p>fill the gap between the little given and the great promised&#x2013;the great</p>
<p>rosegray never-to-be-had. Mes fen&#xE9;tres! Hanging above blotched sunset</p>
<p>and welling night, grinding my teeth, I would crowd all the demons of my</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (190 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>desire against the railing of a throbbing balcony: it would be ready to take</p>
<p>off in the apricot and black humid evening; did take off&#x2013;whereupon the</p>
<p>lighted image would move and Even would revert to a rib, and there would be</p>
<p>nothing in the window but an obese partly clad man reading the paper.</p>
<p> Since I sometimes won the race between my fancy and nature&#x2019;s reality,</p>
<p>the deception was bearable. Unbearable pain began when chance entered the</p>
<p>fray and deprived me of the smile meant for me. &#x201C;Savez-vous qu&#x2019;&#xFE; dix ans</p>
<p>ma petite &#xE8;tait folle de vous?&#x201D; said a woman I talked to at a tea in</p>
<p>Paris, and the petite had just married, miles away, and I could not</p>
<p>even remember if I had ever noticed her in that garden, next to those tennis</p>
<p>courts, a dozen years before. And now likewise, the radiant foreglimpse, the</p>
<p>promise of reality, a promise not only to be simulated seductively but also</p>
<p>to be nobly held&#x2013;all this, chance denied me&#x2013;chance and a change to smaller</p>
<p>characters on the pale beloved writer&#x2019;s part. My fancy was both</p>
<p>Proustianized and Procrusteanized; for that particular morning, late in</p>
<p>September 1952, as I had come down to grope for my mail, the dapper and</p>
<p>bilious janitor with whom I was on execrable terms started to complain that</p>
<p>a man who had seen Rita home recently had been &#x201C;sick like a dog&#x201D; on the</p>
<p>front steps. In the process of listening to him and tipping him, and then</p>
<p>listening to a revised and politer version of the incident, I had the</p>
<p>impression that one of the two letters which that blessed mail brought was</p>
<p>from Rita&#x2019;s mother, a crazy little woman, whom we had once visited on Cape</p>
<p>Cod and who kept writing me to my various addresses, saying how wonderfully</p>
<p>well matched her daughter and I were, and how wonderful it would be if we</p>
<p>married; the other letter which I opened and scanned rapidly in the elevator</p>
<p>was from John Farlow.</p>
<p> I have often noticed that we are inclined to endow our friends with the</p>
<p>stability of type that literary characters acquire in the reader&#x2019;s mind. No</p>
<p>matter how many times we reopen &#x201C;King Lear,&#x201D; never shall we find the good</p>
<p>king banging his tankard in high revelry, all woes forgotten, at a jolly</p>
<p>reunion with all three daughters and their lapdogs. Never will Emma rally,</p>
<p>revived by the sympathetic salts in Flaubert&#x2019;s father&#x2019;s timely tear.</p>
<p>Whatever evolution this or that popular character has gone through between</p>
<p>the book covers, his fate is fixed in our minds, and, similarly, we expect</p>
<p>our friends to follow this or that logical and conventional pattern we have</p>
<p>fixed for them. Thus X will never compose the immortal music that would</p>
<p>clash with the second-rate symphonies he has accustomed us to. Y will never</p>
<p>commit murder. Under no circumstances can Z ever betray us. We have it all</p>
<p>arranged in our minds, and the less often we see a particular person the</p>
<p>more satisfying it is to check how obediently he conforms to our notion of</p>
<p>him every time we hear of him. Any deviation in the fates we have ordained</p>
<p>would strike us as not only anomalous but unethical. We would prefer not to</p>
<p>have known at all our neighbor, the retired hot-dog stand operator, if it</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (191 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>turns out he has just produced the greatest book of poetry his age has seen.</p>
<p> I am saying all this in order to explain how bewildered I was by</p>
<p>Farlow&#x2019;s hysterical letter. I knew his wife had died but I certainly</p>
<p>expected him to remain, throughout a devout widowhood, the dull, sedate and</p>
<p>reliable person he had always been. Now he wrote that after a brief visit to</p>
<p>the U.S. he had returned to South America and had decided that whatever</p>
<p>affairs he had controlled at Ramsdale he would hand over to Jack Windmuller</p>
<p>of that town, a lawyer whom we both knew. He seemed particularly relieved to</p>
<p>get rid of the Haze &#x201C;complications.&#x201D; He had married a Spanish girl. He had</p>
<p>stopped smoking and had gained thirty pounds. She was very young and a ski</p>
<p>champion. They were going to India for their honeymonsoon. Since he was</p>
<p>&#x201C;building a family&#x201D; as he put it, he would have no time henceforth for my</p>
<p>affairs which he termed &#x201C;very strange and very aggravating.&#x201D; Busybodies&#x2013;a</p>
<p>whole committee of them, it appeared&#x2013;had informed him that the whereabouts</p>
<p>of little Dolly Haze were unknown, and that I was living with a notorious</p>
<p>divorcee in California. His father-in-law was a count, and exceedingly</p>
<p>wealthy. The people who had been renting the Haze house for some years now</p>
<p>wished to buy it. He suggested that I better produce Dolly quick. he had</p>
<p>broken his leg. He enclosed a snapshot of himself and a brunette in white</p>
<p>wool beaming at each other among the snows of Chile.</p>
<p> I remember letting myself into my flat and starting to say: Well, at</p>
<p>least we shall now track them down&#x2013;when the other letter began talking to</p>
<p>me in a small matter-of-fact voice:</p>
<p> Dear Dad:</p>
<p> How&#x2019;s everything? I&#x2019;m married. I&#x2019;m going to have a baby. I guess he&#x2019;s</p>
<p>going to be a big one. I guess he&#x2019;ll come right for Christmas. This is a</p>
<p>hard letter to write. I&#x2019;m going nuts because we don&#x2019;t have enough to pay our</p>
<p>debts and get out of here. Dick is promised a big job in Alaska in his very</p>
<p>specialized corner of the mechanical field, that&#x2019;s all I know about it but</p>
<p>it&#x2019;s really grand. Pardon me for withholding our home address but you may</p>
<p>still be mad at me, and Dick must not know. This town is something. You</p>
<p>can&#x2019;t see the morons for the smog. Please do send us a check, Dad. We could</p>
<p>manage with three or four hundred or even less, anything is welcome, you</p>
<p>might sell my old things, because once we go there the dough will just start</p>
<p>rolling in. Writ, please. I have gone through much sadness and hardship.</p>
<p> Yours expecting,</p>
<p> Dolly (Mrs. Richard F. Schiller)</p>
<p> 28</p>
<p> I was again on the road, again at the wheel of the old blue sedan,</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (192 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>again alone. Rita had still been dead to the world when I read that letter</p>
<p>and fought the mountains of agony it raised within me. I had glanced at her</p>
<p>as she smiled in her sleep and had kissed her on her moist brow, and had</p>
<p>left her forever, with a note of tender adieu which I taped to her</p>
<p>navel&#x2013;otherwise she might not have found it.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Alone&#x201D; did I say? Pas tout &#xFE; fait. I had my little black chum</p>
<p>with me, and as soon as I reached a secluded spot, I rehearsed Mr. Richard</p>
<p>F. Schiller&#x2019;s violent death. I had found a very old and very dirty gray</p>
<p>sweater of mine in the back of the car, and this I hung up on a branch, in a</p>
<p>speechless glade, which I had reached by a wood road from the now remote</p>
<p>highway. The carrying out of the sentence was a little marred by what seemed</p>
<p>to me a certain stiffness in the play of the trigger, and I wondered if I</p>
<p>should get some oil for the mysterious thing but decided I had no time to</p>
<p>spare. Back into the car went the old dead sweater, now with additional</p>
<p>perforations, and having reloaded warm Chum, I continued my journey.</p>
<p> The letter was dated September 18, 1952 (this was September 22), and</p>
<p>the address she gave was &#x201C;General Delivery, Coalmont&#x201D; (not &#x201C;Va.,&#x201D; not &#x201C;Pa.,&#x201D;</p>
<p>not &#x201C;Tenn.&#x201D;&#x2013;and not Coalmont, anyway&#x2013;I have camouflaged everything, my</p>
<p>love). Inquiries showed this to be a small industrial community some eight</p>
<p>hundred miles from New York City. At first I planned to drive all day and</p>
<p>all night, but then thought better of it and rested for a couple of hours</p>
<p>around dawn in a motor court room, a few miles before reaching the town. I</p>
<p>had made up my mind that the fiend, this Schiller, had been a car salesman</p>
<p>who had perhaps got to know my Lolita by giving her a ride in Beardsley&#x2013;the</p>
<p>day her bike blew a tire on the way to Miss Emperor&#x2013;and that he had got</p>
<p>into some trouble since then. The corpse of the executed sweater, no matter</p>
<p>how I changed its contours as it lay on the back seat of the car, had kept</p>
<p>revealing various outlines pertaining to Trapp-Schiller&#x2013;the grossness and</p>
<p>obscene bonhomie of his body, and to counteract this taste of coarse</p>
<p>corruption I resolved to make myself especially handsome and smart as I</p>
<p>pressed home the nipple of my alarm clock before it exploded at the set hour</p>
<p>of six a.m. Then, with the stern and romantic care of a gentleman about to</p>
<p>fight a duel, I checked the arrangement of my papers, bathed and perfumed my</p>
<p>delicate body, shaved my face and chest, selected a silk shirt and clean</p>
<p>drawers, pulled on transparent taupe socks, and congratulated myself for</p>
<p>having with me in my trunk some very exquisite clothes&#x2013;a waistcoat with</p>
<p>nacreous buttons, for instance, a pale cashmere tie and so on.</p>
<p> I was not able, alas, to hold my breakfast, but dismissed that</p>
<p>physicality as a trivial contretemps, wiped my mouth with a gossamer</p>
<p>handkerchief produced from my sleeve, and, with a blue block of ice for</p>
<p>heart, a pill on my tongue and solid death in my hip pocket, I stepped</p>
<p>neatly into a telephone booth in Coalmont (Ah-ah-ah, said its little door)</p>
<p>and rang up the only Schiller&#x2013;Paul, Furniture&#x2013;to be found in the battered</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (193 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>book. Hoarse Paul told me he did know a Richard, the son of a cousin of his,</p>
<p>and his address was, let me see, 10 Killer Street (I am not going very far</p>
<p>for my pseudonyms). Ah-ah-ah, said the little door.</p>
<p> At 10 Killer Street, a tenement house, I interviewed a number of</p>
<p>dejected old people and two long-haired strawberry-blond incredibly grubby</p>
<p>nymphets (rather abstractly, just for the heck of it, the ancient beast in</p>
<p>me was casting about for some lightly clad child I might hold against me for</p>
<p>a minute, after the killing was over and nothing mattered any more, and</p>
<p>everything was allowed). Yes, Dick Skiller had lived there, but had moved</p>
<p>when he married. Nobody knew his address. &#x201C;They might know at the store,&#x201D;</p>
<p>said a bass voice from an open manhole near which I happened to be standing</p>
<p>with the two thin-armed, barefoot little girls and their dim grandmothers. I</p>
<p>entered the wrong store and a wary old Negro shook his head even before I</p>
<p>could ask anything. I crossed over to a bleak grocery and there, summoned by</p>
<p>a customer at my request, a woman&#x2019;s voice from some wooden abyss in the</p>
<p>floor, the manhole&#x2019;s counterpart, cried out: Hunter Road, last house.</p>
<p> Hunter Road was miles away, in an even more dismal district, all dump</p>
<p>and ditch, and wormy vegetable garden, and shack, and gray drizzle, and red</p>
<p>mud, and several smoking stacks in the distance. I stopped at the last</p>
<p>&#x201C;house&#x201D;&#x2013;a clapboard shack, with two or three similar ones farther away from</p>
<p>the road and a waste of withered weeds all around. Sounds of hammering came</p>
<p>from behind the house, and for several minutes I sat quite still in my old</p>
<p>car, old and frail, at the end of my journey, at my gray goal, finis,</p>
<p>my friends, finis, my friends. The time was around two. My pulse was</p>
<p>40 one minute and 100 the next. The drizzle crepitated against the hood of</p>
<p>the car. My gun had migrated to my right trouser pocket. A nondescript cur</p>
<p>came out from behind the house, stopped in surprise, and started</p>
<p>good-naturedly woof-woofing at me, his eyes slit, his shaggy belly all</p>
<p>muddy, and then walked about a little and woofed once more.</p>
<p> 29</p>
<p> I got out of the car and slammed its door. How matter-of-fact, how</p>
<p>square that slam sounded in the void of the sunless day! Woof,</p>
<p>commented the dog perfunctorily. I pressed the bell button, it vibrated</p>
<p>through my whole system. Personne. Je resonne. Repersonne. From what</p>
<p>depth this re-nonsense? Woof, said the dog. A rush and a shuffle, and</p>
<p>woosh-woof went the door.</p>
<p> Couple of inches taller. Pink-rimmed glasses. New, heaped-up hairdo,</p>
<p>new ears. How simple! The moment, the death I had kept conjuring up for</p>
<p>three years was as simple as a bit of dry wood. She was frankly and hugely</p>
<p>pregnant. Her head looked smaller (only two seconds had passed really, but</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (194 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>let me give them as much wooden duration as life can stand), and her</p>
<p>pale-freckled cheeks were hollowed, and her bare shins and arms had lost all</p>
<p>their tan, so that the little hairs showed. She wore a brown, sleeveless</p>
<p>cotton dress and sloppy felt slippers.</p>
<p> &#x201C;We&#x2013;e&#x2013;ell!&#x201D; she exhaled after a pause with all the emphasis of wonder</p>
<p>and welcome.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Husband at home?&#x201D; I croaked, fist in pocket.</p>
<p> I could not kill her, of course, as some have thought. You see,</p>
<p>I loved her. It was love at first sight, at last sight, at ever and ever</p>
<p>sight.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Come in,&#x201D; she said with a vehement cheerful note. Against the</p>
<p>splintery deadwood of the door, Dolly Schiller flattened herself as best she</p>
<p>could (even rising on tiptoe a little) to let me pass, and was crucified for</p>
<p>a moment, looking down, smiling down at the threshold, hollow-cheeked with</p>
<p>round pommettes, her watered-milk-white arms outspread on the wood. I</p>
<p>passed without touching her bulging babe. Dolly-smell, with a faint fried</p>
<p>addition. My teeth chattered like an idiot&#x2019;s. &#x201C;No, you stay out&#x201D; (to the</p>
<p>dog). She closed the door and followed me and her belly into the dollhouse</p>
<p>parlor.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Dick&#x2019;s down there,&#x201D; she said pointing with an invisible tennis racket,</p>
<p>inviting my gaze to travel from the drab parlor-bedroom where we stood,</p>
<p>right across the kitchen, and through the back doorway where, in a rather</p>
<p>primitive vista, a dark-haired young stranger in overalls, instantaneously</p>
<p>reprieved, was perched with his back to me on a ladder fixing something near</p>
<p>or upon the shack of his neighbor, a plumper fellow with only one arm, who</p>
<p>stood looking up.</p>
<p> This pattern she explained from afar, apologetically (&#x201C;Men will be</p>
<p>men&#x201D;); should she call him in?</p>
<p> No.</p>
<p> Standing in the middle of the slanting room and emitting questioning</p>
<p>&#x201C;hm&#x2019;s,&#x201D; she made familiar Javanese gestures with her wrists and hands,</p>
<p>offering me, in a brief display of humorous courtesy, to choose between a</p>
<p>rocker and the divan (their bed after ten p.m.). I say &#x201C;familiar&#x201D; because</p>
<p>one day she had welcomed me with the same wrist dance to her party in</p>
<p>Beardsley. We both sat down on the divan. Curious: although actually her</p>
<p>looks had faded, I definitely realized, so hopelessly late in the day, how</p>
<p>much she looked&#x2013;had always looked&#x2013;like Botticelli&#x2019;s russet Venus&#x2013;the same</p>
<p>soft nose, the same blurred beauty. In my pocket my fingers gently let go</p>
<p>and repacked a little at the tip, within the handkerchief it was nested in,</p>
<p>my unused weapon.</p>
<p> &#x201C;that&#x2019;s not the fellow I want,&#x201D; I said.</p>
<p> The diffuse look of welcome left her eyes. Her forehead puckered as in</p>
<p>the old bitter days:</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (195 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p> &#x201C;Not who?&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Where is he? Quick!&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Look,&#x201D; she said, inclining her head to one side and shaking it in that</p>
<p>position. &#x201C;Look, you are not going to bring that up.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;I certainly am,&#x201D; I said, and for a moment&#x2013;strangely enough the only</p>
<p>merciful, endurable one in the whole interview&#x2013;we were bristling at each</p>
<p>other as if she were still mine.</p>
<p> A wise girl, she controlled herself.</p>
<p> Dick did not know a thing of the whole mess. He thought I was her</p>
<p>father. He thought she had run away from an upper-class home just to wash</p>
<p>dishes in a diner. He believed anything. Why should I want to make things</p>
<p>harder than they were by raking up all that muck?</p>
<p> But, I said, she must be sensible, she must be a sensible girl (with</p>
<p>her bare drum under that thin brown stuff), she must understand that if she</p>
<p>expected the help I had come to give, I must have at least a clear</p>
<p>comprehension of the situation.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Come, his name!&#x201D;</p>
<p> She thought I had guessed long ago. It was (with a mischievous and</p>
<p>melancholy smile) such a sensational name. I would never believe it. She</p>
<p>could hardly believe it herself.</p>
<p> His name, my fall nymph.</p>
<p> It was so unimportant, she said. She suggested I skip it. Would I like</p>
<p>a cigarette?</p>
<p> No. His name.</p>
<p> She shook her head with great resolution. She guessed it was too late</p>
<p>to raise hell and I would never believe the unbelievably unbelievable&#x2013;</p>
<p> I said I had better go, regards, nice to have seen her.</p>
<p> She said really it was useless, she would never tell, but on the other</p>
<p>hand, after all&#x2013;&#x201D;Do you really want to know who it was? Well, it was&#x2013;&#x201D;</p>
<p> And softly, confidentially, arching her thin eyebrows and puckering her</p>
<p>parched lips, she emitted, a little mockingly, somewhat fastidiously, not</p>
<p>untenderly, in a kind of muted whistle, the name that the astute reader has</p>
<p>guessed long ago.</p>
<p> Waterproof. Why did a flash from Hourglass Lake cross my consciousness?</p>
<p>I, too, had known it, without knowing it, all along. There was no shock, no</p>
<p>surprise. Quietly the fusion took place, and everything fell into order,</p>
<p>into the pattern of branches that I have woven throughout this memoir with</p>
<p>the express purpose of having the ripe fruit fall at the right moment; yes,</p>
<p>with the express and perverse purpose of rendering&#x2013;she was talking but I</p>
<p>sat melting in my golden peace&#x2013;of rendering that golden and monstrous peace</p>
<p>through the satisfaction of logical recognition, which my most inimical</p>
<p>reader should experience now.</p>
<p> She was, as I say, talking. It now came in a relaxed flow. He was the</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (196 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>only man she had ever been crazy about. What about Dick? Oh, Dick was a</p>
<p>lamb, they were quite happy together, but she meant something different. And</p>
<p>I had never counted, of course?</p>
<p> She considered me as if grasping all at once the incredible&#x2013;and</p>
<p>somehow tedious, confusing and unnecessary&#x2013;fact that the distant, elegant,</p>
<p>slender, forty-year-old valetudinarian in velvet coat sitting beside her had</p>
<p>known and adored every pore and follicle of her pubescent body. In her</p>
<p>washed-out gray eyes, strangely spectacled, our poor romance was for a</p>
<p>moment reflected, pondered upon, and dismissed like a dull party, like a</p>
<p>rainy picnic to which only the dullest bores had come, like a humdrum</p>
<p>exercise, like a bit of dry mud caking her childhood.</p>
<p> I just managed to jerk my knee out of the range of a sketchy tap&#x2013;one</p>
<p>of her acquired gestures.</p>
<p> She asked me not to be dense. The past was the past. I had been a good</p>
<p>father, she guessed&#x2013;granting me that. Proceed, Dolly Schiller.</p>
<p> Well, did I know that he had known her mother? That he was practically</p>
<p>an old friend? That he had visited with his uncle in Ramsdale?&#x2013;oh, years</p>
<p>ago&#x2013;and spoken at Mother&#x2019;s club, and had tugged and pulled her, Dolly, by</p>
<p>her bare arm onto his lap in front of everybody, and kissed her face, she</p>
<p>was ten and furious with him? Did I know he had seen me and her at the inn</p>
<p>where he was writing the very play she was to rehearse in Beardsley, two</p>
<p>years later? Did I know&#x2013;It had been horrid of her to sidetrack me into</p>
<p>believing that Clare was an old female, maybe a relative of his or a</p>
<p>sometime lifemate&#x2013;and oh, what a close shave it had been when the Wace</p>
<p>Journal carried his picture.</p>
<p> The Briceland Gazette had not. Yes, very amusing.</p>
<p> Yes, she said, this world was just one gag after another, if somebody</p>
<p>wrote up her life nobody would ever believe it.</p>
<p> At this point, there came brisk homey sounds from the kitchen into</p>
<p>which Dick and Bill had lumbered in quest of beer. Through the doorway they</p>
<p>noticed the visitor, and Dick entered the parlor.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Dick, this is my Dad!&#x201D; cried Dolly in a resounding violent voice that</p>
<p>struck me as a totally strange, and new, and cheerful, and old, and sad,</p>
<p>because the young fellow, veteran of a remote war, was hard of hearing.</p>
<p> Arctic blue eyes, black hair, ruddy cheeks, unshaven chin. We shook</p>
<p>hands. Discreet Bill, who evidently took pride in working wonders with one</p>
<p>hand, brought in the beer cans he had opened. Wanted to withdraw. The</p>
<p>exquisite courtesy of simple folks. Was made to stay. A beer ad. In point of</p>
<p>fact, I preferred it that way, and so did the Schillers. I switched to the</p>
<p>jittery rocker. Avidly munching, Dilly plied me with marshmallows and potato</p>
<p>chips. The men looked at her fragile, frileux, diminutive, old-world,</p>
<p>youngish but sickly, father in velvet coat and beige vest, maybe a viscount.</p>
<p> They were under the impression I had come to stay, and Dick with a</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (197 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>great wrinkling of brows that denoted difficult thought, suggested Dolly and</p>
<p>he might sleep in the kitchen on a spare mattress. I waved a light hand and</p>
<p>told Dolly who transmitted it by means of a special shout to Dick that I had</p>
<p>merely dropped in on my way to Readsburg where I was to be entertained by</p>
<p>some friends and admirers. It was then noticed that one of the few thumbs</p>
<p>remaining to Bill was bleeding (not such a wonder-worker after all). How</p>
<p>womanish and somehow never seen that way before was the shadowy division</p>
<p>between her pale breasts when she bent down over the man&#x2019;s hand! She took</p>
<p>him for repairs to the kitchen. For a few minutes, three or four little</p>
<p>eternities which positively welled with artificial warmth, Dick and I</p>
<p>remained alone. He sat on a hard chair rubbing his forelimbs and frowning. I</p>
<p>had an idle urge to squeeze out the blackheads on the wings of his</p>
<p>perspiring nose with my long agate claws. He had nice sad eyes with</p>
<p>beautiful lashes, and very white teeth. His Adam&#x2019;s apple was large and</p>
<p>hairy. Why don&#x2019;t they shave better, those young brawny chaps? He and his</p>
<p>Dolly had had unrestrained intercourse on that couch there, at least a</p>
<p>hundred and eighty times, probably much more; and before that&#x2013;how long had</p>
<p>she known him? No grudge. Funny&#x2013;no grudge at all, nothing except grief and</p>
<p>nausea. He was now rubbing his nose. I was sure that when finally he would</p>
<p>open his mouth, he would say (slightly shaking his head): &#x201C;Aw, she&#x2019;s a swell</p>
<p>kid, Mr. Haze. She sure is. And she&#x2019;s going to make a swell mother.&#x201D; He</p>
<p>opened his mouth&#x2013;and took a sip of beer. This gave him countenance&#x2013;and he</p>
<p>went on sipping till he frothed at the mouth. He was a lamb. He had cupped</p>
<p>her Florentine breasts. His fingernails were black and broken, but the</p>
<p>phalanges, the whole carpus, the strong shapely wrist were far, far finer</p>
<p>than mine: I have hurt too much too many bodies with my twisted poor hands</p>
<p>to be proud of them. French epithets, a Dorset yokel&#x2019;s knuckles, an Austrian</p>
<p>tailor&#x2019;s flat finger tips&#x2013;that&#x2019;s Humbert Humbert.</p>
<p> Good. If he was silent I could be silent too. Indeed, I could very well</p>
<p>do with a little rest in this subdued, frightened-to-death rocking chair,</p>
<p>before I drove to wherever the beast&#x2019;s lair was&#x2013;and then pulled the</p>
<p>pistol&#x2019;s foreskin back, and then enjoyed the orgasm of the crushed trigger:</p>
<p>I was always a good little follower of the Viennese medicine man. But</p>
<p>presently I became sorry for poor Dick whom, in some hypnotoid way, I was</p>
<p>horribly preventing from making the only remark he could think up (&#x201C;She&#x2019;s a</p>
<p>swell kid. . .&#x201D;).</p>
<p> &#x201C;And so,&#x201D; I said, &#x201C;you are going to Canada?&#x201D;</p>
<p> In the kitchen, Dolly was laughing at something Bill had said or done.</p>
<p> &#x201C;And so,&#x201D; I shouted, &#x201C;you are going to Canada? Not Canada&#x201D;&#x2013;I</p>
<p>re-shouted&#x2013;&#x201D;I mean Alaska, of course.&#x201D;</p>
<p> He nursed his glass and, nodding sagely, replied: &#x201C;Well, he cut it on a</p>
<p>jagger, I guess. Lost his right arm in Italy.&#x201D;</p>
<p> Lovely mauve almond trees in bloom. A blown-off surrealistic arm</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (198 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>hanging up there in the pointillistic mauve. A flowergirl tattoo on the</p>
<p>hand. Dolly and band-aided Bill reappeared. It occurred to me that her</p>
<p>ambiguous, brown and pale beauty excited the cripple. Dick, with a grin of</p>
<p>relief stood up. He guessed Bill and he would be going back to fix those</p>
<p>wires. He guessed Mr. Haze and Dolly had loads of things to say to each</p>
<p>other. He guessed he would be seeing me before I left. Why do those people</p>
<p>guess so much and shave so little, and are so disdainful of hearing aids?</p>
<p> &#x201C;Sit down,&#x201D; she said, audibly striking her flanks with her palms. I</p>
<p>relapsed into the black rocker.</p>
<p> &#x201C;So you betrayed me? Where did you go? Where is he now?&#x201D;</p>
<p> She took from the mantelpiece a concave glossy snapshot. Old woman in</p>
<p>white, stout, beaming, bowlegged, very short dress; old man in his</p>
<p>shirtsleeves, drooping mustache, watch chain. Her in-laws. Living with</p>
<p>Dick&#x2019;s brother&#x2019;s family in Juneau.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Sure you don&#x2019;t want to smoke?&#x201D;</p>
<p> She was smoking herself. First time I saw her doing it. Streng</p>
<p>verboten under Humbert the Terrible. Gracefully, in a blue mist,</p>
<p>Charlotte Haze rose from her grave. I would find him through Uncle Ivory if</p>
<p>she refused.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Betrayed you? No.&#x201D; She directed the dart of her cigarette, index</p>
<p>rapidly tapping upon it, toward the hearth exactly as her mother used to do,</p>
<p>and then, like her mother, oh my God, with her fingernail scratched and</p>
<p>removed a fragment of cigarette paper from her underlip. No. She had not</p>
<p>betrayed me. I was among friends. Edusa had warned her that Cue liked little</p>
<p>girls, had been almost jailed once, in fact (nice fact), and he knew she</p>
<p>knew. Yes . . . Elbow in palm, puff, smile, exhaled smoke, darting gesture.</p>
<p>Waxing reminiscent. He saw&#x2013;smiling&#x2013;through everything and everybody,</p>
<p>because he was not like me and her but a genius. A great guy. Full of fun.</p>
<p>Had rocked with laughter when she confessed about me and her, and said he</p>
<p>had thought so. It was quite safe, under the circumstances, to tell him . .</p>
<p>.</p>
<p> Well, Cue&#x2013;they all called him Cue&#x2013;</p>
<p> Her camp five years ago. Curious coincidence&#x2013;. . . took her to a dude</p>
<p>ranch about a day&#x2019;s drive from Elephant (Elphinstone). Named? Oh, some silly</p>
<p>name&#x2013;Duk Duk Ranch&#x2013;you know just plain silly&#x2013;but it did not matter</p>
<p>now, anyway, because the place had vanished and disintegrated. Really, she</p>
<p>meant, I could not imagine how utterly lush that ranch was, she meant it had</p>
<p>everything but everything, even an indoor waterfall. Did I remember the</p>
<p>red-haired guy we (&#x201C;we&#x201D; was good) had once had some tennis with? Well, the</p>
<p>place really belonged to Red&#x2019;s brother, but he had turned it over to Cue for</p>
<p>the summer. When Cue and she came, the others had them actually go through a</p>
<p>coronation ceremony and then&#x2013;a terrific ducking, as when you cross the</p>
<p>Equator. You know.</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (199 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p> Her eyes rolled in synthetic resignation.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Go on, please.&#x201D;</p>
<p> Well. The idea was he would take her in September to Hollywood and</p>
<p>arrange a tryout for her, a bit part in the tennis-match scene of a movie</p>
<p>picture based on a play of his&#x2013;Golden Guts&#x2013;and perhaps even have</p>
<p>her double one of its sensational starlets on the Klieg-struck tennis court.</p>
<p>Alas, it never came to that.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Where is the hog now?&#x201D;</p>
<p> He was not a hog. He was a great guy in many respects. But it was all</p>
<p>drink and drugs. And, of course, he was a complete freak in sex matters, and</p>
<p>his friends were his slaves. I just could not imagine (I, Humbert, could not</p>
<p>imagine!) what they all did at Duk Duk Ranch. She refused to take part</p>
<p>because she loved him, and he threw her out.</p>
<p> &#x201C;What things?&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Oh, weird, filthy, fancy things. I mean, he had two girls and tow</p>
<p>boys, and three or four men, and the idea was for all of us to tangle in the</p>
<p>nude while an old woman took movie pictures.&#x201D; (Sade&#x2019;s Justine was twelve at</p>
<p>the start.)</p>
<p> &#x201C;What things exactly?&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Oh, things . . . Oh, I&#x2013;really I&#x201D;&#x2013;she uttered the &#x201C;I&#x201D; as a subdued</p>
<p>cry while she listened to the source of the ache, and for lack of words</p>
<p>spread the five fingers of her angularly up-and-down-moving hand. No, she</p>
<p>gave it up, she refused to go into particulars with that baby inside her.</p>
<p> That made sense.</p>
<p> &#x201C;It is of no importance now,&#x201D; she said pounding a gray cushion with her</p>
<p>fist and then lying back, belly up, on the divan. &#x201C;Crazy things, filthy</p>
<p>things. I said no, I&#x2019;m just not going to [she used, in all insouciance</p>
<p>really, a disgusting slang term which, in a literal French translation,</p>
<p>would be souffler] your beastly boys, because I want only you. Well,</p>
<p>he kicked me out.&#x201D;</p>
<p> There was not much else to tell. That winter 1949, Fay and she had</p>
<p>found jobs. For almost two years she had&#x2013;oh, just drifted, oh, doing some</p>
<p>restaurant work in small places, and then she had met Dick. No, she did not</p>
<p>know where the other was. In New York, she guessed. Of course, he was so</p>
<p>famous she would have found him at once if she had wanted. Fay had tried to</p>
<p>get back to the Ranch&#x2013;and it just was not there any more&#x2013;it had burned to</p>
<p>the ground, nothing remained, just a charred heap of rubbish. It was</p>
<p>so strange, so strange&#x2013;</p>
<p> She closed her eyes and opened her mouth, leaning back on the cushion,</p>
<p>one felted foot on the floor. The wooden floor slanted, a little steel ball</p>
<p>would have rolled into the kitchen. I knew all I wanted to know. I had no</p>
<p>intention of torturing my darling. Somewhere beyond Bill&#x2019;s shack an</p>
<p>afterwork radio had begun singing of folly and fate, and there she was with</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (200 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>her ruined looks and her adult, rope-veined narrow hands and her goose-flesh</p>
<p>white arms, and her shallow ears, and her unkempt armpits, there she was (my</p>
<p>Lolita!), hopelessly worn at seventeen, with that baby, dreaming already in</p>
<p>her of becoming a big shot and retiring around 2020 A.D.&#x2013;and I looked and</p>
<p>looked at her, and knew as clearly as I know I am to die, that I loved her</p>
<p>more than anything I had ever seen or imagined on earth, or hoped for</p>
<p>anywhere else. She was only the faint violet whiff and dead leaf echo of the</p>
<p>nymphet I had rolled myself upon with such cries in the past; an echo on the</p>
<p>brink of a russet ravine, with a far wood under a white sky, and brown</p>
<p>leaves choking the brook, and one last cricket in the crisp weeds . . . but</p>
<p>thank God it was not that echo alone that I worshipped. What I used to</p>
<p>pamper among the tangled vines of my heart, mon grand p&#xE8;ch&#xE8; radieux,</p>
<p>had dwindled to its essence: sterile and selfish vice, all that I</p>
<p>canceled and cursed. You may jeer at me, and threaten to clear the court,</p>
<p>but until I am gagged and half-throttled, I will shout my poor truth. I</p>
<p>insist the world know how much I loved my Lolita, this Lolita, pale</p>
<p>and polluted, and big with another&#x2019;s child, but still gray-eyed, still</p>
<p>sooty-lashed, still auburn and almond, still Carmencita, still mine;</p>
<p>Changeons de vie, ma Carmen, allons vivre quelque part o&#xFB; nous ne serons</p>
<p>jamais s&#xE8;par&#xE8;s; Ohio? The wilds of Massachusetts? No matter, even if</p>
<p>those eyes of hers would fade to myopic fish, and her nipples swell and</p>
<p>crack, and her lovely young velvety delicate delta be tainted and torn&#x2013;even</p>
<p>then I would go mad with tenderness at the mere sight of your dear wan face,</p>
<p>at the mere sound of your raucous young voice, my Lolita.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Lolita,&#x201D; I said, &#x201C;this may be neither here nor there but I have to say</p>
<p>it. Life is very short. From here to that old car you know so well there is a</p>
<p>stretch of twenty, twenty-five paces. It is a very short walk. Make those</p>
<p>twenty-five steps. Now. Right now. Come just as you are. And we shall live</p>
<p>happily ever after.&#x201D;</p>
<p> Carmen, voulez-vous venir avec moi?</p>
<p> &#x201C;You mean,&#x201D; she said opening her eyes and raising herself slightly, the</p>
<p>snake that may strike, &#x201C;you mean you will give us [us] that money only if I</p>
<p>go with you to a motel. Is that what you mean?&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;No,&#x201D; I said, &#x201C;you got it all wrong. I want you to leave your</p>
<p>incidental Dick, and this awful hole, and come to live with me, and die with</p>
<p>me, and everything with me&#x201D; (words to that effect).</p>
<p> &#x201C;You&#x2019;re crazy,&#x201D; she said, her features working.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Think it over, Lolita. There are no strings attached. Except,</p>
<p>perhaps&#x2013;well, no matter.&#x201D; (A reprieve, I wanted to say but did not.)</p>
<p>&#x201C;Anyway, if you refuse you will still get your . . . trousseau.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;No kidding?&#x201D; asked Dolly.</p>
<p> I handed her an envelope with four hundred dollars in cash and a check</p>
<p>for three thousand six hundred more.</p>

<p> Gingerly, uncertainly, she received mon petit cadeau; and then</p>
<p>her forehead became a beautiful pink. &#x201C;You mean,&#x201D; she said, with agonized</p>
<p>emphasis, &#x201C;you are giving us four thousand bucks?&#x201D; I covered my face</p>
<p>with my hand and broke into the hottest tears I had ever shed. I felt them</p>
<p>winding through my fingers and down my chin, and burning me, and my nose got</p>
<p>clogged, and I could not stop, and then she touched my wrist.</p>
<p> &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll die if you touch me,&#x201D; I said. &#x201C;You are sure you are not coming</p>
<p>with me? Is there no hope of your coming? Tell me only this.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;No,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;No, honey, no.&#x201D;</p>
<p> She had never called me honey before.</p>
<p> &#x201C;No,&#x201D; she said, &#x201C;it is quite out of the question. I would sooner go</p>
<p>back to Cue. I mean&#x2013;&#x201D;</p>
<p> She groped for words. I supplied them mentally (&#x201C;He broke my</p>
<p>heart. You merely broke my life&#x201D;).</p>
<p> &#x201C;I think,&#x201D; she went on&#x2013;&#x201D;oops&#x201D;&#x2013;the envelope skidded to the floor&#x2013;she</p>
<p>picked it up&#x2013;&#x201D;I think it&#x2019;s oh utterly grand of you to give us all</p>
<p>that dough. It settles everything, we can start next week. Stop crying,</p>
<p>please. You should understand. Let me get you some more beer. Oh, don&#x2019;t cry,</p>
<p>I&#x2019;m so sorry I cheated so much, but that&#x2019;s the way things are.&#x201D;</p>
<p> I wiped my face and my fingers. She smiled at the cadeau. She</p>
<p>exulted. She wanted to call Dick. I said I would have to leave in a moment,</p>
<p>did not want to see him at all, at all. We tried to think of some subject of</p>
<p>conversation. For some reason, I kept seeing&#x2013;it trembled and silkily glowed</p>
<p>on my damn retina&#x2013;a radiant child of twelve, sitting on a threshold,</p>
<p>&#x201C;pinging&#x201D; pebbles at an empty can. I almost said&#x2013;trying to find some casual</p>
<p>remark&#x2013;&#x201D;I wonder sometimes what has become of the little McCoo girl, did</p>
<p>she ever get better?&#x201D;&#x2013;but stopped in time lest she rejoin: &#x201C;I wonder</p>
<p>sometimes what has become of the little Haze girl . . .&#x201D; Finally, I reverted</p>
<p>to money matters. That sum, I said, represented more or less the net rent</p>
<p>from her mother&#x2019;s house; she said: &#x201C;Had it not been sold years ago?&#x201D; No (I</p>
<p>admit I had told her this in order to sever all connections with R.);</p>
<p>a lawyer would send a full account of the financial situation later; it was</p>
<p>rosy; some of the small securities her mother had owned had gone up and up.</p>
<p>Yes, I was quite sure I had to go. I had to go, and find him, and destroy</p>
<p>him.</p>
<p> Since I would not have survived the touch of her lips, I kept</p>
<p>retreating in a mincing dance, at every step she and her belly made toward</p>
<p>me.</p>
<p> She and the dog saw me off. I was surprised (this a rhetorical figure,</p>
<p>I was not) that the sight of the old car in which she had ridden as a child</p>
<p>and a nymphet, left her so very indifferent. All she remarked was it was</p>
<p>getting sort of purplish about the gills. I said it was hers, I could go by</p>
<p>bus. She said don&#x2019;t be silly, they would fly to Jupiter and buy a car there.</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (202 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>I said I would buy this one from her for five hundred dollars.</p>
<p> &#x201C;At this rate we&#x2019;ll be millionnaires next,&#x201D; she said to the ecstatic</p>
<p>dog.</p>
<p> Carmencita, lui demandais-je . . . &#x201C;One last word,&#x201D; I said in my</p>
<p>horrible careful English, &#x201C;are you quite, quite sure that&#x2013;well, not</p>
<p>tomorrow, of course, and not after tomorrow, but&#x2013;well&#x2013;some day, any day,</p>
<p>you will not come to live with me? I will create a brand new God and thank</p>
<p>him with piercing cries, if you give me that microscopic hope&#x201D; (to that</p>
<p>effect).</p>
<p> &#x201C;No,&#x201D; she said smiling, &#x201C;no.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;It would have made all the difference,&#x201D; said Humbert Humbert.</p>
<p> Then I pulled out my automatic&#x2013;I mean, this is the kind of fool thing</p>
<p>a reader might suppose I did. It never even occurred to me to do it.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Good by-aye!&#x201D; she changed, my American sweet immortal dead love; for</p>
<p>she is dead and immortal if you are reading this. I mean, such is the formal</p>
<p>agreement with the so-called authorities.</p>
<p> Then, as I drove away, I heard her shout in a vibrant voice to her</p>
<p>Dick; and the dog started to lope alongside my car like a fat dolphin, but</p>
<p>he was too heavy and old, and very soon gave up.</p>
<p> And presently I was driving through the drizzle of the dying day, with</p>
<p>the windshield wipers in full action but unable to cope with my tears.</p>
<p> 30</p>
<p> Leaving as I did Coalmont around four in the afternoon (by Route X&#x2013;I</p>
<p>do not remember the number(, I might have made Ramsdale by dawn had not a</p>
<p>short-cut tempted me. I had to get onto Highway Y. My map showed quite</p>
<p>blandly that just beyond Woodbine, which I reached at nightfall, I could</p>
<p>leave paved X and reached paved Y by means of a transverse dirt road. It was</p>
<p>only some forty miles long according to my map. Otherwise I would have to</p>
<p>follow X for another hundred miles and then use leisurely looping Z to get</p>
<p>to Y and my destination. However, the short-cut in question got worse and</p>
<p>worse, bumpier and bumpier, muddier and muddier, and when I attempted to</p>
<p>turn back after some ten miles of purblind, tortuous and tortoise-slow</p>
<p>progress, my old and weak Melmoth got stuck in deep clay. All was dark and</p>
<p>muggy, and hopeless. My headlights hung over a broad ditch full of water.</p>
<p>The surrounding country, if any, was a black wilderness. I sought to</p>
<p>extricate myself but my rear wheels only whined in slosh and anguish.</p>
<p>Cursing my plight, I took off my fancy clothes, changed into slacks, pulled</p>
<p>on the bullet-riddled sweater, and waded four miles back to a roadside farm.</p>
<p>It started to rain on the way but I had not the strength to go back for a</p>
<p>mackintosh. Such incidents have convinced me that my heart is basically</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (203 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>sound despite recent diagnoses. Around midnight, a wrecker dragged my car</p>
<p>out. I navigated back to Highway X and traveled on. Utter weariness overtook</p>
<p>me and hour later, in an anonymous little town. I pulled up at the curb and</p>
<p>in darkness drank deep from a friendly flask.</p>
<p> The rain had been canceled miles before. It was a black warm night,</p>
<p>somewhere in Appalachia. Now and then cars passed me, red tail-lights</p>
<p>receding, white headlights advancing, but the town was dead. Nobody strolled</p>
<p>and laughed on the sidewalks as relaxing burghers would in sweet, mellow,</p>
<p>rotting Europe. I was alone to enjoy the innocent night and my terrible</p>
<p>thoughts. A wire receptacle on the curb was very particular about acceptable</p>
<p>contents: Sweepings. Paper. No Garbage. Sherry-red letters of light marked a</p>
<p>Camera Shop. A large thermometer with the name of a laxative quietly dwelt</p>
<p>on the front of a drugstore. Rubinov&#x2019;s Jewelry company had a display of</p>
<p>artificial diamonds reflected in a red mirror. A lighted green clock swam in</p>
<p>the linenish depths of Jiffy Jeff Laundry. On the other side of the street a</p>
<p>garage said in its sleep&#x2013;genuflection lubricity; and corrected itself to</p>
<p>Gulflex Lubrication. An airplane, also gemmed by Rubinov, passed, droning,</p>
<p>in the velvet heavens. How many small dead-of-night towns I had seen! This</p>
<p>was not yet the last.</p>
<p> Let me dally a little, he is as good as destroyed. Some way further</p>
<p>across the street, neon lights flickered twice slower than my heart: the</p>
<p>outline of a restaurant sign, a large coffee-pot, kept bursting, every full</p>
<p>second or so, into emerald life, and every time it went out, pink letters</p>
<p>saying Fine Foods relayed it, but the pot could still be made out as a</p>
<p>latent shadow teasing the eye before its next emerald resurrection. We made</p>
<p>shadow-graphs. This furtive burg was not far from The Enchanted Hunters. I</p>
<p>was weeping again, drunk on the impossible past.</p>
<p> 31</p>
<p> At this solitary stop for refreshments between Coalmont and Ramsdale</p>
<p>(between innocent Dolly Schiller and jovial Uncle Ivor), I reviewed my case.</p>
<p>With the utmost simplicity and clarity I now saw myself and my love.</p>
<p>Previous attempts seemed out of focus in comparison. A couple of years</p>
<p>before, under the guidance of an intelligent French-speaking confessor, to</p>
<p>whom, in a moment of metaphysical curiosity, I had turned over a</p>
<p>Protestant&#x2019;s drab atheism for an old-fashioned popish cure, I had hoped to</p>
<p>deduce from my sense of sin the existence of a Supreme Being. On those</p>
<p>frosty mornings in rime-laced Quebec, the good priest worked on me with the</p>
<p>finest tenderness and understanding. I am infinitely obliged to him and the</p>
<p>great Institution he represented. Alas, I was unable to transcend the simple</p>
<p>human fact that whatever spiritual solace I might find, whatever lithophanic</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (204 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>eternities might be provided for me, nothing could make my Lolita forget the</p>
<p>foul lust I had inflicted upon her. Unless it can be proven to me&#x2013;to me as</p>
<p>I am now, today, with my heart and by beard, and my putrefaction&#x2013;that in</p>
<p>the infinite run it does not matter a jot that a North American girl-child</p>
<p>named Dolores Haze had been deprived of her childhood by a maniac, unless</p>
<p>this can be proven (and if it can, then life is a joke), I see nothing for</p>
<p>the treatment of my misery but the melancholy and very local palliative of</p>
<p>articulate art. To quote an old poet:</p>
<p> The moral sense in mortals is the duty</p>
<p> We have to pay on mortal sense of beauty.</p>
<p> 32</p>
<p> There was the day, during our first trip&#x2013;our first circle of</p>
<p>paradise&#x2013;when in order to enjoy my phantasms in peace I firmly decided to</p>
<p>ignore what I could not help perceiving, the fact that I was to her not a</p>
<p>boy friend, not a glamour man, not a pal, not even a person at all, but just</p>
<p>two eyes and a foot of engorged brawn&#x2013;to mention only mentionable matters.</p>
<p>There was the day when having withdrawn the functional promise I had made</p>
<p>her on the eve (whatever she had set her funny little heart on&#x2013;a roller</p>
<p>rink with some special plastic floor or a movie matinee to which she wanted</p>
<p>to go alone), I happened to glimpse from the bathroom, through a chance</p>
<p>combination of mirror aslant and door ajar, a look on her face . . . that</p>
<p>look I cannot exactly describe . . . an expression of helplessness so</p>
<p>perfect that it seemed to grade into one of rather comfortable inanity just</p>
<p>because this was the very limit of injustice and frustration&#x2013;and every</p>
<p>limit presupposes something beyond it&#x2013;hence the neutral illumination. And</p>
<p>when you bear in mind that these were the raised eyebrows and parted lips of</p>
<p>a child, you may better appreciate what depths of calculated carnality, what</p>
<p>reflected despair, restrained me from falling at her dear feet and</p>
<p>dissolving in human tears, and sacrificing my jealousy to whatever pleasure</p>
<p>Lolita might hope to derive from mixing with dirty and dangerous children in</p>
<p>an outside world that was real to her.</p>
<p> And I have still other smothered memories, now unfolding themselves</p>
<p>into limbless monsters of pain. Once, in a sunset-ending street of</p>
<p>Beardsley, she turned to little Eva Rosen (I was taking both nymphets to a</p>
<p>concert and walking behind them so close as almost to touch them with my</p>
<p>person), she turned to Eva, and so very serenely and seriously, in answer to</p>
<p>something the other had said about its being better to die than hear Milton</p>
<p>Pinski, some local schoolboy she knew, talk about music, my Lolita remarked:</p>
<p> &#x201C;You know, what&#x2019;s so dreadful about dying is that you are completely on</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (205 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>your own&#x201D;; and it struck me, as my automaton knees went up and down, that I</p>
<p>simply did not know a thing about my darling&#x2019;s mind and that quite possibly,</p>
<p>behind the awful juvenile clich&#xE8;s, there was in her a garden and a twilight,</p>
<p>and a palace gate&#x2013;dim and adorable regions which happened to be lucidly and</p>
<p>absolutely forbidden to me, in my polluted rags and miserable convulsions;</p>
<p>for I often noticed that living as we did, she and I, in a world of total</p>
<p>evil, we would become strangely embarrassed whenever I tried to discuss</p>
<p>something she and an older friend, she and a parent, she and a real healthy</p>
<p>sweetheart, I and Annabel, Lolita and a sublime, purified, analyzed, deified</p>
<p>Harold Haze, might have discussed&#x2013;an abstract idea, a painting, stippled</p>
<p>Hopkins or shorn Baudelaire, God or Shakespeare, anything of genuine kind.</p>
<p>Good will! She would mail her vulnerability in trite brashness and boredom,</p>
<p>whereas I, using for my desperately detached comments an artificial tone of</p>
<p>voice that set my own last teeth on edge, provoked my audience to such</p>
<p>outbursts of rudeness as made any further conversation impossible, oh my</p>
<p>poor, bruised child.</p>
<p> I loved you. I was a pentapod monster, but I loved you. I was</p>
<p>despicable and brutal, and turpid, and everything, mais je t&#x2019;aimais, je</p>
<p>t&#x2019;aimais! And there were times when I knew how you felt, and it was hell</p>
<p>to know it, my little one. Lolita girl, brave Dolly Schiller.</p>
<p> I recall certain moments, let us call them icebergs in paradise, when</p>
<p>after having had my fill of her&#x2013;after fabulous, insane exertions that left</p>
<p>me limp and azure-barred&#x2013;I would gather her in my arms with, at last, a</p>
<p>mute moan of human tenderness (her skin glistening in the neon light coming</p>
<p>from the paved court through the slits in the blind, her soot-black lashes</p>
<p>matted, her grave gray eyes more vacant than ever&#x2013;for all the world a</p>
<p>little patient still in the confusion of a drug after a major</p>
<p>operation)&#x2013;and the tenderness would deepen to shame and despair, and I</p>
<p>would lull and rock my lone light Lolita in my marble arms, and moan in her</p>
<p>warm hair, and caress her at random and mutely ask her blessing, and at the</p>
<p>peak of this human agonized selfless tenderness (with my soul actually</p>
<p>hanging around her naked body and ready to repent), all at once, ironically,</p>
<p>horribly, lust would swell again&#x2013;and &#x201C;oh, no,&#x201D; Lolita would say with</p>
<p>a sigh to heaven, and the next moment the tenderness and the azure&#x2013;all</p>
<p>would be shattered.</p>
<p> Mid-twentieth century ideas concerning child-parent relationship have</p>
<p>been considerably tainted by the scholastic rigmarole and standardized</p>
<p>symbols of the psychoanalytic racket, but I hope I am addressing myself to</p>
<p>unbiased readers. Once when Avis&#x2019;s father had honked outside to signal papa</p>
<p>had come to take his pet home, I felt obliged to invite him into the parlor,</p>
<p>and he sat down for a minute, and while we conversed, Avis, a heavy,</p>
<p>unattractive, affectionate child, drew up to him and eventually perched</p>
<p>plumply on his knee. Now, I do not remember if I have mentioned that Lolita</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (206 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>always had an absolutely enchanting smile for strangers, a tender furry</p>
<p>slitting of the eyes, a dreamy sweet radiance of all her features which did</p>
<p>not mean a thing of course, but was so beautiful, so endearing that one</p>
<p>found it hard to reduce such sweetness to but a magic gene automatically</p>
<p>lighting up her face in atavistic token of some ancient rite of</p>
<p>welcome&#x2013;hospitable prostitution, the coarse reader may say. Well, there she</p>
<p>stood while Mr. Byrd twirled his hat and talked, and&#x2013;yes, look how stupid</p>
<p>of me, I have left out the main characteristic of the famous Lolita smile,</p>
<p>namely: while the tender, nectared, dimpled brightness played, it was never</p>
<p>directed at the stranger in the room but hung in its own remote flowered</p>
<p>void, so to speak, or wandered with myopic softness over chance objects&#x2013;and</p>
<p>this is what was happening now: while fat Avis sidled up to her papa, Lolita</p>
<p>gently beamed at a fruit knife that she fingered on the edge of the table,</p>
<p>whereon she leaned, many miles away from me. Suddenly, as Avis clung to her</p>
<p>father&#x2019;s neck and ear while, with a casual arm, the man enveloped his lumpy</p>
<p>and large offspring, I saw Lolita&#x2019;s smile lose all its light and become a</p>
<p>frozen little shadow of itself, and the fruit knife slipped off the table</p>
<p>and struck her with its silver handle a freak blow on the ankle which made</p>
<p>her gasp, and crouch head forward, and then, jumping on one leg, her face</p>
<p>awful with the preparatory grimace which children hold till the tears gush,</p>
<p>she was gone&#x2013;to be followed at once and consoled in the kitchen by Avis who</p>
<p>had such a wonderful fat pink dad and a small chubby brother, and a</p>
<p>brand-new baby sister, and a home, and two grinning dogs, and Lolita had</p>
<p>nothing. And I have a neat pendant to that little scene&#x2013;also in a Beardsley</p>
<p>setting. Lolita, who had been reading near the fire, stretched herself, and</p>
<p>then inquired, her elbow up, with a grunt: &#x201C;Where is she buried anyway?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Who?&#x201D; &#x201C;Oh, you know, my murdered mummy.&#x201D; &#x201C;And you know where her</p>
<p>grave is,&#x201D; I said controlling myself, whereupon I named the cemetery&#x2013;just</p>
<p>outside Ramsdale, between the railway tracks and Lakeview Hill. &#x201C;Moreover,&#x201D;</p>
<p>I added, &#x201C;the tragedy of such an accident is somewhat cheapened by the</p>
<p>epithet you saw fit to apply to it. If you really wish to triumph in your</p>
<p>mind over the idea of death&#x2013;&#x201D; &#x201C;Ray,&#x201D; said Lo for hurrah, and languidly left</p>
<p>the room, and for a long while I stared with smarting eyes into the fire.</p>
<p>Then I picked up her book. It was some trash for young people. There was a</p>
<p>gloomy girl Marion, and there was her stepmother who turned out to be,</p>
<p>against all expectations, a young, gay, understanding redhead who explained</p>
<p>to Marion that Marion&#x2019;s dead mother had really been a heroic woman since she</p>
<p>had deliberately dissimulated her great love for Marion because she was</p>
<p>dying, and did not want her child to miss her. I did not rush up to her room</p>
<p>with cries. I always preferred the mental hygiene of noninterference. Now,</p>
<p>squirming and pleading with my own memory, I recall that on this and similar</p>
<p>occasions, it was always my habit and method to ignore Lolita&#x2019;s states of</p>
<p>mind while comforting my own base self. When my mother, in a livid wet</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (207 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>dress, under the tumbling mist (so I vividly imagined her), had run panting</p>
<p>ecstatically up that ridge above Moulinet to be felled there by a</p>
<p>thunderbolt, I was but an infant, and in retrospect no yearnings of the</p>
<p>accepted kind could I ever graft upon any moment of my youth, no matter how</p>
<p>savagely psychotherapists heckled me in my later periods of depression. But</p>
<p>I admit that a man of my power of imagination cannot plead personal</p>
<p>ignorance of universal emotions. I may also have relied too much on the</p>
<p>abnormally chill relations between Charlotte and her daughter. But the awful</p>
<p>point of the whole argument is this. It had become gradually clear to my</p>
<p>conventional Lolita during our singular and bestial cohabitation that even</p>
<p>the most miserable of family lives was better than the parody of incest,</p>
<p>which, in the long run, was the best I could offer the waif.</p>
<p> 33</p>
<p> Ramsdale revisited. I approached it from the side of the lake. The</p>
<p>sunny noon was all eyes. As I rode by in my mud-flecked car, I could</p>
<p>distinguish scintillas of diamond water between the far pines. I turned into</p>
<p>the cemetery and walked among the long and short stone monuments.</p>
<p>Bonzhur, Charlotte. On some of the graves there were pale,</p>
<p>transparent little national flags slumped in the windless air under the</p>
<p>evergreens. Gee, Ed, that was bad luck&#x2013;referring to G. Edward Grammar, a</p>
<p>thirty-five-year-old New York office manager who had just been arrayed on a</p>
<p>charge of murdering his thirty-three-year-old wife, Dorothy. Bidding for the</p>
<p>perfect crime, Ed had bludgeoned his wife and put her into a car. The case</p>
<p>came to light when two county policemen on patrol saw Mrs. Grammar&#x2019;s new big</p>
<p>blue Chrysler, an anniversary present from her husband, speeding crazily</p>
<p>down a hill, just inside their jurisdiction (God bless our good cops!). The</p>
<p>car sideswiped a pole, ran up an embankment covered with beard grass, wild</p>
<p>strawberry and cinquefoil, and overturned. The wheels were still gently</p>
<p>spinning in the mellow sunlight when the officers removed Mrs. G&#x2019;s body. It</p>
<p>appeared to be routine highway accident at first. Alas, the woman&#x2019;s battered</p>
<p>body did not match up with only minor damage suffered by the car. I did</p>
<p>better.</p>
<p> I rolled on. It was funny to see again the slender white church and the</p>
<p>enormous elms. Forgetting that in an American suburban street a lone</p>
<p>pedestrian is more conspicuous than a lone motorist, I left the car in the</p>
<p>avenue to walk unobtrusively past 342 Lawn Street. Before the great</p>
<p>bloodshed, I was entitled to a little relief, to a cathartic spasm of mental</p>
<p>regurgitation. Closed were the white shutters of the Junk mansion, and</p>
<p>somebody had attached a found black velvet hair ribbon to the white FOR SALE</p>
<p>sign which was leaning toward the sidewalk. No dog barked. No gardener</p>

<p>telephoned. No Miss Opposite sat on the vined porch&#x2013;where to the lone</p>
<p>pedestrian&#x2019;s annoyance two pony-tailed young women in identical polka-dotted</p>
<p>pinafores stopped doing whatever they were doing to stare at him: she was</p>
<p>long dead, no doubt, these might be her twin nieces from Philadelphia.</p>
<p> Should I enter my old house? As in a Turgenev story, a torrent of</p>
<p>Italian music came from an open window&#x2013;that of the living room: what</p>
<p>romantic soul was playing the piano where no piano had plunged and plashed</p>
<p>on that bewitched Sunday with the sun on her beloved legs? All at once I</p>
<p>noticed that from the lawn I had mown a golden-skinned, brown-haired nymphet</p>
<p>of nine or ten, in white shorts, was looking at me with wild fascination in</p>
<p>her large blue-black eyes. I said something pleasant to her, meaning no</p>
<p>harm, an old-world compliment, what nice eyes you have, but she retreated in</p>
<p>haste and the music stopped abruptly, and a violent-looking dark man,</p>
<p>glistening with sweat, came out and glared at me. I was on the point of</p>
<p>identifying myself when, with a pang of dream-embarrassment, I became aware</p>
<p>of my mud-caked dungarees, my filthy and torn sweater, my bristly chin, my</p>
<p>bum&#x2019;s bloodshot eyes. Without saying a word, I turned and plodded back the</p>
<p>way I had come. An aster-like anemic flower grew out of a remembered chink</p>
<p>in the sidewalk. Quietly resurrected, Miss Opposite was being wheeled out by</p>
<p>her nieces, onto her porch, as if it were a stage and I the star performer.</p>
<p>Praying she would not call to me, I hurried to my car. What a steep little</p>
<p>street. What a profound avenue. A red ticket showed between wiper and</p>
<p>windshield; I carefully tore it into two, four, eight pieces.</p>
<p> Feeling I was losing my time, I drove energetically to the downtown</p>
<p>hotel where I had arrived with a new bag more than five years before. I took</p>
<p>a room, made two appointments by telephone, shaved, bathed, put on black</p>
<p>clothes and went down for a drink in the bar. Nothing had changed. The</p>
<p>barroom was suffused with the same dim, impossible garnet-red light that in</p>
<p>Europe years ago went with low haunts, but here meant a bit of atmosphere in</p>
<p>a family hotel. I sat at the same little table where at the very start of my</p>
<p>stay, immediately after becoming Charlotte&#x2019;s lodger, I had thought fit to</p>
<p>celebrate the occasion by suavely sharing with her half a bottle of</p>
<p>champagne, which had fatally conquered her poor brimming heart. As then, a</p>
<p>moon-faced waiter was arranging with stellar care fifty sherries on a round</p>
<p>tray for a wedding party. Murphy-Fantasia, this time. It was eight minutes</p>
<p>to three. As I walked though the lobby, I had to skirt a group of ladies who</p>
<p>with mille gr&#xE1;ces were taking leave of each other after a luncheon</p>
<p>party. With a harsh cry of recognition, one pounced upon me. She was a</p>
<p>stout, short woman in pearl-gray, with a long, gray, slim plume to her small</p>
<p>hat. It was Mrs. Chatfield. She attacked me with a fake smile, all aglow</p>
<p>with evil curiosity. (Had I done to Dolly, perhaps, what Frank Lasalle, a</p>
<p>fifty-year-old mechanic, had done o eleven-year-old Sally Horner in 1948?)</p>
<p>Very soon I had that avid glee well under control She thought I was in</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (209 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>California. How was&#x2013;? With exquisite pleasure I informed her that my</p>
<p>stepdaughter had just married a brilliant young mining engineer with a</p>
<p>hush-hush job in the Northwest. She said she disapproved of such early</p>
<p>marriages, she would never let her Phillys, who was now eighteen&#x2013;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Oh yes, of course,&#x201D; I said quietly. &#x201C;I remember Phyllis. Phyllis and</p>
<p>Camp Q. yes, of course. By the way, did she ever tell you how Charlie Holmes</p>
<p>debauched there his mother&#x2019;s little charges?&#x201D;</p>
<p> Mrs. Chatfiled&#x2019;s already broken smile now disintegrated completely.</p>
<p> &#x201C;For shame,&#x201D; she cried, &#x201C;for shame, Mr. Humbert! The poor boy has just</p>
<p>been killed in Korea.&#x201D;</p>
<p> I said didn&#x2019;t she think &#x201C;vient de,&#x201D; with the infinitive,</p>
<p>expressed recent events so much more neatly than the English &#x201C;just,&#x201D; with</p>
<p>the past? But I had to be trotting off, I said.</p>
<p> There were only two blocks to Windmuller&#x2019;s office. He greeted me with a</p>
<p>very slow, very enveloping, strong, searching grip. He thought I was in</p>
<p>California. Had I not lived at one time at Beardsley? His daughter had just</p>
<p>entered Beardsley College. And how was&#x2013;? I have all necessary information</p>
<p>about Mrs. Schiller. We had a pleasant business conference. I walked out</p>
<p>into the hot September sunshine a contented pauper.</p>
<p> Now that everything had been put out of the way, I could dedicate</p>
<p>myself freely to the main object of my visit to Ramsdale. In the methodical</p>
<p>manner on which I have always prided myself, I had been keeping Clare</p>
<p>Quilty&#x2019;s face masked in my dark dungeon, where he was waiting for me to come</p>
<p>with barber and priest: &#x201C;R&#xE8;veillez-vous, Laqueue, il est temps de</p>
<p>mourir!&#x201D; I have no time right now to discuss the mnemonics of</p>
<p>physiognomization&#x2013;I am on my way to his uncle and walking fast&#x2013;but let me</p>
<p>jot down this: I had preserved in the alcohol of a clouded memory the toad</p>
<p>of a face. In the course of a few glimpses, I had noticed its slight</p>
<p>resemblance to a cheery and rather repulsive wine dealer, a relative of mine</p>
<p>in Switzerland. With his dumbbells and stinking tricot, and fat hairy arms,</p>
<p>and bald patch, and pig-faced servant-concubine, he was on the whole a</p>
<p>harmless old rascal. Too harmless, in fact, to be confused with my prey. In</p>
<p>the state of mind I now found myself, I had lost contact with Trapp&#x2019;s image.</p>
<p>It had become completely engulfed by the face of Clare Quilty&#x2013;as</p>
<p>represented, with artistic precision, by an easeled photograph of him that</p>
<p>stood on his uncle&#x2019;s desk.</p>
<p> In Beardsley, at the hands of charming Dr. Molnar, I had undergone a</p>
<p>rather serious dental operation, retaining only a few upper and lower front</p>
<p>teeth. The substitutes were dependent on a system of plates with an</p>
<p>inconspicuous wire affair running along my upper gums. The whole arrangement</p>
<p>was a masterpiece of comfort, and my canines were in perfect health.</p>
<p>However, to garnish my secret purpose with a plausible pretext, I told Dr.</p>
<p>Quilty that, in hope of alleviating facial neuralgia, I had decided to have</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (210 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>all my teeth removed. What would a complete set of dentures cost? How long</p>
<p>would the process take, assuming we fixed our first appointment for some</p>
<p>time in November? Where was his famous nephew now? Would it be possible to</p>
<p>have them all out in one dramatic session?</p>
<p> A white-smocked, gray-haired man, with a crew cut and the big flat</p>
<p>cheeks of a politician, Dr. Quilty perched on the corner of his desk, one</p>
<p>foot dreamily and seductively rocking as he launched on a glorious</p>
<p>long-range plan. He would first provide me with provisional plates until the</p>
<p>gums settled. Then he would make me a permanent set. He would like to have a</p>
<p>look at that mouth of mine. He wore perforated pied shoes. He had not</p>
<p>visited with the rascal since 1946, but supposed he could be found at his</p>
<p>ancestral home, Grimm Road, not far from Parkington. It was a noble dream.</p>
<p>His foot rocked, his gaze was inspired. It would cost me around six hundred.</p>
<p>He suggested he take measurements right away, and make the first set before</p>
<p>starting operations. My mouth was to him a splendid cave full of priceless</p>
<p>treasures, but I denied him entrance.</p>
<p> &#x201C;No,&#x201D; I said. &#x201C;On second thoughts, I shall have it all done by Dr.</p>
<p>Molnar. His price is higher, but he is of course a much better dentist than</p>
<p>you.&#x201D;</p>
<p> I do not know if any of my readers will ever have a chance to say that.</p>
<p>It is a delicious dream feeling. Clare&#x2019;s uncle remained sitting on the desk,</p>
<p>still looking dreamy, but his foot had stopped push-rocking the cradle of</p>
<p>rosy anticipation. On the other hand, his nurse, a skeleton-thin, faded</p>
<p>girl, with the tragic eyes of unsuccessful blondes, rushed after me so as to</p>
<p>be able to slam the door in my wake.</p>
<p> Push the magazine into the butt. Press home until you hear or feel the</p>
<p>magazine catch engage. Delightfully snug. Capacity: eight cartridges. Full</p>
<p>Blued. Aching to be discharged.</p>
<p> 34</p>
<p> A gas station attendant in Parkington explained to me very clearly how</p>
<p>to get to Grimm Road. Wishing to be sure Quilty would be at home, I</p>
<p>attempted to ring him up but learned that his private telephone had recently</p>
<p>been disconnected. Did that mean he was gone? I started to drive to Grimm</p>
<p>Road, twelve miles north of the town. By that time night had eliminated most</p>
<p>of the landscape and as I followed the narrow winding highway, a series of</p>
<p>short posts, ghostly white, with reflectors, borrowed my own lights to</p>
<p>indicate this or that curve. I could make out a dark valley on one side of</p>
<p>the road and wooded slopes on the other, and in front of me, like derelict</p>
<p>snowflakes, moths drifted out of the blackness into my probing aura. At the</p>
<p>twelfth mile, as foretold, a curiously hooded bridge sheathed me for a</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (211 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>moment and, beyond it, a white-washed rock loomed on the right, and a few</p>
<p>car lengths further, on the same side, I turned off the highway up gravelly</p>
<p>Grimm Road. For a couple of minutes all was dank, dark, dense forest. Then,</p>
<p>Pavor Manor, a wooden house with a turret, arose in a circular clearing. Its</p>
<p>windows glowed yellow and red; its drive was cluttered with half a dozen</p>
<p>cars. I stopped in the shelter of the trees and abolished my lights to</p>
<p>ponder the next move quietly. He would be surrounded by his henchmen and</p>
<p>whores. I could not help seeing the inside of that festive and ramshackle</p>
<p>castle in terms of &#x201C;Troubled Teens,&#x201D; a story in one of her magazines, vague</p>
<p>&#x201C;orgies,&#x201D; a sinister adult with penele cigar, drugs, bodyguards. At least,</p>
<p>he was there. I would return in the torpid morning.</p>
<p> Gently I rolled back to town, in that old faithful car of mine which</p>
<p>was serenely, almost cheerfully working for me. My Lolita! There was still a</p>
<p>three-year-old bobby pin of hers in the depths of the glove compartment.</p>
<p>There was still that stream of pale moths siphoned out of the night by my</p>
<p>headlights. Dark barns still propped themselves up here and there by the</p>
<p>roadside. People were still going to the movies. While searching for night</p>
<p>lodgings, I passed a drive-in. In a selenian glow, truly mystical in its</p>
<p>contrast with the moonless and massive night, on a gigantic screen slanting</p>
<p>away among dark drowsy fields, a thin phantom raised a gun, both he and his</p>
<p>arm reduced to tremulous dishwater by the oblique angle of that receding</p>
<p>world,&#x2013;and the next moment a row of trees shut off the gesticulation.</p>
<p> 35</p>
<p> I left Insomnia Lodge next morning around eight and spent some time in</p>
<p>Parkington. Visions of bungling the execution kept obsessing me. Thinking</p>
<p>that perhaps the cartridges in the automatic had gone stale during a week of</p>
<p>inactivity, I removed them and inserted a fresh batch. Such a thorough oil</p>
<p>bath did I give Chum that now I could not get rid of the stuff. I bandaged</p>
<p>him up with a rag, like a maimed limb, and used another rag to wrap up a</p>
<p>handful of spare bullets.</p>
<p> A thunderstorm accompanied me most of the way back to Grimm Road, but</p>
<p>when I reached Pavor Manor, the sun was visible again, burning like a man,</p>
<p>and the birds screamed in the drenched and steaming trees. The elaborate and</p>
<p>decrepit house seemed to stand in a kind of daze, reflecting as it were my</p>
<p>own state, for I could not help realizing, as my feet touched the springy</p>
<p>and insecure ground, that I had overdone the alcoholic stimulation business.</p>
<p> A guardedly ironic silence answered my bell. The garage, however, was</p>
<p>loaded with his car, a black convertible for the nonce. I tried the knocker.</p>
<p>Re-nobody. With a petulant snarl, I pushed the front door&#x2013;and, how nice, it</p>
<p>swung open as in a medieval fairy tale. Having softly closed it behind me, I</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (212 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p>made my way across a spacious and very ugly hall; peered into an adjacent</p>
<p>drawing room; noticed a number of used glasses growing out of the carpet;</p>
<p>decided that master was still asleep in the master bedroom.</p>
<p> So I trudged upstairs. My right hand clutched muffled Chum in my</p>
<p>pocket, my left patted the sticky banisters. Of the three bedrooms I</p>
<p>inspected, one had obviously been slept in that night. There was a library</p>
<p>full of flowers. There was a rather bare room with ample and deep mirrors</p>
<p>and a polar bear skin on the slippery floor. There were still other rooms. A</p>
<p>happy though struck me. If and when master returned from his constitutional</p>
<p>in the woods, or emerged from some secret lair, it might be wise for an</p>
<p>unsteady gunman with a long job before him to prevent his playmate from</p>
<p>locking himself up in a room. Consequently, for at least five minutes I went</p>
<p>about&#x2013;lucidly insane, crazily calm, an enchanted and very tight</p>
<p>hunter&#x2013;turning whatever keys in whatever locks there were and pocketing</p>
<p>more planned privacy than have modern glamour-boxes, where the bathroom, the</p>
<p>only lockable locus, has to be used for the furtive needs of planned</p>
<p>parenthood.</p>
<p> Speaking of bathrooms&#x2013;I was about to visit a third one when master</p>
<p>came out of it, leaving a brief waterfall behind him. The corner of a</p>
<p>passage did not quite conceal me. Gray-faced, baggy-eyed, fluffily</p>
<p>disheveled in a scanty balding way, but still perfectly recognizable, he</p>
<p>swept by me in a purple bathrobe, very like one I had. He either did not</p>
<p>notice me, or else dismissed me as some familiar and innocuous</p>
<p>hallucination&#x2013;and, showing me his hairy calves, he proceeded,</p>
<p>sleepwalker-wise, downstairs. I pocketed my last key and followed him into</p>
<p>the entrance hall. He had half opened his mouth and the front door, to peer</p>
<p>out through a sunny chink as one who thinks he has heard a half-hearted</p>
<p>visitor ring and recede. Then, still ignoring the raincoated phantasm that</p>
<p>had stopped in midstairs, master walked into a cozy boudoir across the hall</p>
<p>from the drawing room, through which&#x2013;taking it easy, knowing he was safe&#x2013;I</p>
<p>now went away from him, and in a bar-adorned kitchen gingerly unwrapped</p>
<p>dirty Chum, talking care not to leave any oil stains on the chrome&#x2013;I think</p>
<p>I got the wrong product, it was black and awfully messy. In my usual</p>
<p>meticulous way, I transferred naked Chum to a clean recess about me and made</p>
<p>for the little boudoir. My step, as I say, was springy&#x2013;too springy perhaps</p>
<p>for success. But my heart pounded with tiger joy, and I crunched a cocktail</p>
<p>glass underfoot.</p>
<p> Master met me in the Oriental parlor.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Now who are you?&#x201D; he asked in a high hoarse voice, his hands thrust</p>
<p>into his dressing-gown pockets, his eyes fixing a point to the northeast of</p>
<p>my head. &#x201C;Are you by any chance Brewster?&#x201D;</p>
<p> By now it was evident to everybody that he was in a fog and completely</p>
<p>at my so-called mercy. I could enjoy myself.</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (213 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p> &#x201C;That&#x2019;s right,&#x201D; I answered suavely. &#x201C;Je suis Monsieur Brust&#xF5;re.</p>
<p>Let us chat for a moment before we start.&#x201D;</p>
<p> He looked pleased. His smudgy mustache twitched. I removed my raincoat.</p>
<p>I was wearing a black suit, a black shirt, no tie. We sat down in two easy</p>
<p>chairs.</p>
<p> &#x201C;You know,&#x201D; he said, scratching loudly his fleshy and gritty gray cheek</p>
<p>and showing his small pearly teeth in a crooked grin, &#x201C;you don&#x2019;t look</p>
<p>like Jack Brewster. I mean, the resemblance is not particularly striking.</p>
<p>Somebody told me he had a brother with the same telephone company.&#x201D;</p>
<p> To have him trapped, after those years of repentance and rage . . . To</p>
<p>look at the black hairs on the back of his pudgy hands . . . To wander with</p>
<p>a hundred eyes over his purple silks and hirsute chest foreglimpsing the</p>
<p>punctures, and mess, and music of pain . . . To know that this</p>
<p>semi-animated, subhuman trickster who had sodomized my darling&#x2013;oh, my</p>
<p>darling, this was intolerable bliss!</p>
<p> &#x201C;No, I am afraid I am neither of the Brewsters.&#x201D;</p>
<p> He cocked his head, looking more pleased than ever.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Guess again, Punch.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Ah,&#x201D; said Punch, &#x201C;so you have not come to bother me about those</p>
<p>long-distance calls?&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;You do make them once in a while, don&#x2019;t you?&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Excuse me?&#x201D;</p>
<p> I said I had said I thought he had said he had never&#x2013;</p>
<p> &#x201C;People,&#x201D; he said, &#x201C;people in general, I&#x2019;m not accusing you, Brewster,</p>
<p>but you know it&#x2019;s absurd the way people invade this damned house without</p>
<p>even knocking. They use the vaterre, they use the kitchen, they use</p>
<p>the telephone. Phil calls Philadelphia. Pat calls Patagonia. I refuse to</p>
<p>pay. You have a funny accent, Captain.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Quilty,&#x201D; I said, &#x201C;do you recall a little girl called Dolores Haze,</p>
<p>Dolly Haze? Dolly called Dolores, Colo.?&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Sure, she may have made those calls, sure. Any place. Paradise, Wash.,</p>
<p>Hell Canyon. Who cares?&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;I do, Quilty. You see, I am her father.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Nonsense,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;You are not. You are some foreign literary agent.</p>
<p>A Frenchman once translated my Proud Flesh as La Fiert&#xE8; de la</p>
<p>Chair. Absurd.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;She was my child, Quilty.&#x201D;</p>
<p> In the state he was in he could not really be taken aback by anything,</p>
<p>but his blustering manner was not quite convincing. A sort of wary inkling</p>
<p>kindled his eyes into a semblance of life. They were immediately dulled</p>
<p>again.</p>
<p> &#x201C;I&#x2019;m very fond of children myself,&#x201D; he said, &#x201C;and fathers are among my</p>
<p>best friends.&#x201D;</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (214 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p> He turned his head away, looking for something. He beat his pockets. He</p>
<p>attempted to rise from his seat.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Down!&#x201D; I said&#x2013;apparently much louder than I intended.</p>
<p> &#x201C;You need not roar at me,&#x201D; he complained in his strange feminine</p>
<p>manner. &#x201C;I just wanted a smoke. I&#x2019;m dying for a smoke.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;You&#x2019;re dying anyway.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Oh, chucks,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;You begin to bore me. What do you want? Are you</p>
<p>French, mister? Wooly-woo-boo-are? Let&#x2019;s go to the barroomette and have a</p>
<p>stiff&#x2013;&#x201D;</p>
<p> He saw the little dark weapon lying in my palm as if I were offering it</p>
<p>to him.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Say!&#x201D; he drawled (now imitating the underworld numskull of movies),</p>
<p>&#x201C;that&#x2019;s a swell little gun you&#x2019;ve got there. What d&#x2019;you want for her?&#x201D;</p>
<p> I slapped down his outstretched hand and he managed to knock over a box</p>
<p>on a low table near him. It ejected a handful of cigarettes.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Here they are,&#x201D; he said cheerfully. &#x201C;You recall Kipling: une femme</p>
<p>est une femme, mais un Caporal est une cigarette? Now we need matches.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Quilty,&#x201D; I said. &#x201C;I want you to concentrate. You are going to die in a</p>
<p>moment. The hereafter for all we know may be an eternal state of</p>
<p>excruciating insanity. You smoked your last cigarette yesterday.</p>
<p>Concentrate. Try to understand what is happening to you.&#x201D;</p>
<p> He kept taking the Drome cigarette apart and munching bits of it.</p>
<p> &#x201C;I am willing to try,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;You are either Australian, or a German</p>
<p>refugee. Must you talk to me? This is a Gentile&#x2019;s house, you know. Maybe,</p>
<p>you&#x2019;d better run along. And do stop demonstrating that gun. I&#x2019;ve an old</p>
<p>Stern-Luger in the music room.&#x201D;</p>
<p> I pointed Chum at his slippered foot and crushed the trigger. It</p>
<p>clicked. He looked at his foot, at the pistol, again at his foot. I made</p>
<p>another awful effort, and, with a ridiculously feeble and juvenile sound, it</p>
<p>went off. The bullet entered the thick pink rug, and I had the paralyzing</p>
<p>impression that it had merely trickled in and might come out again.</p>
<p> &#x201C;See what I mean?&#x201D; said Quilty. &#x201C;You should be a little more careful.</p>
<p>Give me that thing for Christ&#x2019;s sake.&#x201D;</p>
<p> He reached for it. I pushed him back into the chair. The rich joy was</p>
<p>waning. It was high time I destroyed him, but he must understand why he was</p>
<p>being destroyed. His condition infected me, the weapon felt limp and clumsy</p>
<p>in my hand.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Concentrate,&#x201D; I said, &#x201C;on the thought of Dolly Haze whom you</p>
<p>kidnapped&#x2013;&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;I did not!&#x201D; he cried. &#x201C;You&#x2019;re all wet. I saved her from a beastly</p>
<p>pervert. Show me your badge instead of shooting at my foot, you ape, you.</p>
<p>Where is that badge? I&#x2019;m not responsible for the rapes of others. Absurd!</p>
<p>That joy ride, I grant you, was a silly stunt but you got her back, didn&#x2019;t</p>

<p>you? Come, let&#x2019;s have a drink.&#x201D;</p>
<p> I asked him whether he wanted to be executed sitting or standing.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Ah, let me think,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;It is not an easy question.</p>
<p>Incidentally&#x2013;I made a mistake. Which I sincerely regret. You see, I had no</p>
<p>fun with your Dolly. I am practically impotent, to tell the melancholy</p>
<p>truth. And I gave her a splendid vacation. She met some remarkable people.</p>
<p>Do you happen to know&#x2013;&#x201D;</p>
<p> And with a tremendous lurch he fell all over me, sending the pistol</p>
<p>hurtling under a chest of drawers. Fortunately he was more impetuous than</p>
<p>vigorous, and I had little difficulty in shoving him back into his chair.</p>
<p> He puffed a little and folded his arms on his chest.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Now you&#x2019;ve done it,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;Vous voil&#xFE; dans de beaux draps, mon</p>
<p>vieux.&#x201D;</p>
<p> His French was improving.</p>
<p> I looked around. Perhaps, if&#x2013;Perhaps I could&#x2013;On my hands and knees?</p>
<p>Risk it?</p>
<p> &#x201C;Alors, que fait-on?&#x201D; he asked watching me closely.</p>
<p> I stooped. He did not moved. I stooped lower.</p>
<p> &#x201C;My dear sir,&#x201D; he said, &#x201C;stop trifling with life and death. I am a</p>
<p>playwright. I have written tragedies, comedies, fantasies. I have made</p>
<p>private movies out of Justine and other eighteenth-century</p>
<p>sexcapades. I&#x2019;m the author of fifty-two successful scenarios. I know all the</p>
<p>ropes. Let me handle this. There should be a poker somewhere, why don&#x2019;t I</p>
<p>fetch it, and then we&#x2019;ll fish out your property.&#x201D;</p>
<p> Fussily, busybodily, cunningly, he had risen again while he talked. I</p>
<p>groped under the chest trying at the same time to keep an eye on him. All of</p>
<p>a sudden I noticed that he had noticed that I did not seem to have noticed</p>
<p>Chum protruding from beneath the other corner of the chest. We fell to</p>
<p>wrestling again. We rolled all over the floor, in each other&#x2019;s arms, like</p>
<p>two huge helpless children. He was naked and goatish under his robe, and I</p>
<p>felt suffocated as he rolled over me. I rolled over him. We rolled over me.</p>
<p>They rolled over him. We rolled over us.</p>
<p> In its published form, this book is being read, I assume, in the first</p>
<p>years of 2000 A.D. (1935 plus eighty or ninety, live long, my love); and</p>
<p>elderly readers will surely recall at this point the obligatory scene in the</p>
<p>Westerns of their childhood. Our tussle, however, lacked the ox-stunning</p>
<p>fisticuffs, the flying furniture. He and I were two large dummies, stuffed</p>
<p>with dirty cotton and rags. It was a silent, soft, formless tussle on the</p>
<p>part of two literati, one of whom was utterly disorganized by a drug while</p>
<p>the other was handicapped by a heart condition and too much gin. When at</p>
<p>last I had possessed myself of my precious weapon, and the scenario writer</p>
<p>had been reinstalled in his low chair, both of us were panting as the cowman</p>
<p>and the sheepman never do after their battle.</p>

<p> I decided to inspect the pistol&#x2013;our sweat might have spoiled</p>
<p>something&#x2013;and regain my wind before proceeding to the main item in the</p>
<p>program. To fill in the pause, I proposed he read his own sentence&#x2013;in the</p>
<p>poetical form I had given it. The term &#x201C;poetical justice&#x201D; is one that may be</p>
<p>most happily used in this respect. I handed him a neat typescript.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Yes,&#x201D; he said, &#x201C;splendid idea. Let me fetch my reading glasses&#x201D; (he</p>
<p>attempted to rise).</p>
<p> &#x201C;No.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Just as you say. Shall I read out loud?&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;Here goes. I see it&#x2019;s in verse.</p>
<p> Because you took advantage of a sinner</p>
<p> because you took advantage</p>
<p> because you took</p>
<p> because you took advantage of my disadvantage . . .</p>
<p> &#x201C;That&#x2019;s good, you know. That&#x2019;s damned good.&#x201D;</p>
<p> . . . when I stood Adam-naked</p>
<p> before a federal law and all its stinging stars</p>
<p> &#x201C;Oh, grand stuff!&#x201D;</p>
<p> . . . Because you took advantage of a sin</p>
<p> when I was helpless moulting moist and tender</p>
<p> hoping for the best</p>
<p> dreaming of marriage in a mountain state</p>
<p> aye of a litter of Lolitas . . .</p>
<p> &#x201C;Didn&#x2019;t get that.&#x201D;</p>
<p> Because you took advantage of my inner</p>
<p> essential innocence</p>
<p> because you cheated me&#x2013;</p>
<p> &#x201C;A little repetitious, what? Where was I?&#x201D;</p>
<p> Because you cheated me of my redemption</p>
<p> because you took</p>
<p> her at the age when lads</p>
<p> play with erector sets</p>
<p>file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt (217 of 224)18/12/2003 23:07:54file:///D|/docs/fiction/Nabokov%20-%20Lolita.txt</p>
<p> &#x201C;Getting smutty, eh?&#x201D;</p>
<p> a little downy girl still wearing poppies</p>
<p> still eating popcorn in the colored gloam</p>
<p> where tawny Indians took paid croppers</p>
<p> because you stole her</p>
<p> from her wax-browed and dignified protector</p>
<p> spitting into his heavy-lidded eye</p>
<p> ripping his flavid toga and at dawn</p>
<p> leaving the hog to roll upon his new discomfort</p>
<p> the awfulness of love and violets</p>
<p> remorse despair while you</p>
<p> took a dull doll to pieces</p>
<p> and threw its head away</p>
<p> because of all you did</p>
<p> because of all I did not</p>
<p> you have to die</p>
<p> &#x201C;Well, sir, this is certainly a fine poem. Your best as far as I&#x2019;m</p>
<p>concerned.&#x201D;</p>
<p> He folded and handed it back to me.</p>
<p> I asked him if he had anything serious to say before dying. The</p>
<p>automatic was again ready for use on the person. He looked at it and heaved</p>
<p>a big sigh.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Now look here, Mac,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;You are drunk and I am a sick man. Let</p>
<p>us postpone the matter. I need quiet. I have to nurse my impotence. Friends</p>
<p>are coming in the afternoon to take me to a game. This pistol-packing farce</p>
<p>is becoming a frightful nuisance. We are men of the world, in</p>
<p>everything&#x2013;sex, free verse, marksmanship. If you bear me a grudge, I am</p>
<p>ready to make unusual amends. Even an old-fashioned rencontre, sword</p>
<p>or pistol, in Rio or elsewhere&#x2013;is not excluded. My memory and my eloquence</p>
<p>are not at their best today, but really, my dear Mr. Humbert, you were not</p>
<p>an ideal stepfather, and I did not force your little prot&#xE8;g&#xE8;e to join me. It</p>
<p>was she made me remove her to a happier home. This house is not as modern as</p>
<p>that ranch we shared with dear friends. But it is roomy, cool in summer and</p>
<p>winter, and in a word comfortable, so, since I intend retiring to England or</p>
<p>Florence forever, I suggest you move in. It is yours, gratis. Under the</p>
<p>condition you stop pointing at me that [he swore disgustingly] gun. By the</p>
<p>way, I do not know if you care for the bizarre, but if you do, I can offer</p>
<p>you, also gratis, as house pet, a rather exciting little freak, a young lady</p>
<p>with three breasts, one a dandy, this is a rare and delightful marvel of</p>
<p>nature. Now, soyons raisonnables. You will only wound me hideously</p>
<p>and then rot in jail while I recuperate in a tropical setting. I promise</p>

<p>you, Brewster, you will be happy here, with a magnificent cellar, and all</p>
<p>the royalties from my next play&#x2013;I have not much at the bank right now but I</p>
<p>propose to borrow&#x2013;you know, as the Bard said, with that cold in his head,</p>
<p>to borrow and to borrow and to borrow. There are other advantages. We have</p>
<p>here a most reliable and bribable charwoman, a Mrs. Vibrissa&#x2013;curious</p>
<p>name&#x2013;who comes from the village twice a week, alas not today, she has</p>
<p>daughters, granddaughters, a thing or two I know about the chief of police</p>
<p>makes him my slave. I am a playwright. I have been called the American</p>
<p>Maeterlinck. Maeterlinck-Schmetterling, says I. Come on! All this is very</p>
<p>humiliating, and I am not sure I am doing the right thing. Never use</p>
<p>herculanita with rum. Now drop that pistol like a good fellow. I knew your</p>
<p>dear wife slightly. You may use my wardrobe. Oh, another thing&#x2013;you are</p>
<p>going to like this. I have an absolutely unique collection of erotica</p>
<p>upstairs. Just to mention one item: the in folio de-luxe Bagration</p>
<p>Island by the explorer and psychoanalyst Melanie Weiss, a remarkable</p>
<p>lady, a remarkable work&#x2013;drop that gun&#x2013;with photographs of eight hundred</p>
<p>and something male organs she examined and measured in 1932 on Bagration, in</p>
<p>the Barda Sea, very illuminating graphs, plotted with love under pleasant</p>
<p>skies&#x2013;drop that gun&#x2013;and moreover I can arrange for you to attend</p>
<p>executions, not everybody knows that the chair is painted yellow&#x2013;&#x201D;</p>
<p> Feu. This time I hit something hard. I hit the back of a black</p>
<p>rocking chair, not unlike Dolly Schiller&#x2019;s&#x2013;my bullet hit the inside surface</p>
<p>of its back whereupon it immediately went into a rocking act, so fast and</p>
<p>with such zest that any one coming into the room might have been</p>
<p>flabbergasted by the double miracle: that chair rocking in a panic all by</p>
<p>itself, and the armchair, where my purple target had just been, now void of</p>
<p>all life content. Wiggling his fingers in the air, with a rapid heave of his</p>
<p>rump, he flashed into the music room and the next second we were tugging and</p>
<p>gasping on both sides of the door which had a key I had overlooked. I won</p>
<p>again, and with another abrupt movement Clare the Impredictable sat down</p>
<p>before the piano and played several atrociously vigorous, fundamentally</p>
<p>hysterical, plangent chords, his jowls quivering, his spread hands tensely</p>
<p>plunging, and his nostrils emitting the soundtrack snorts which had been</p>
<p>absent from our fight. Still singing those impossible sonorities, he made a</p>
<p>futile attempt to open with his foot a kind of seaman&#x2019;s chest near the</p>
<p>piano. My next bullet caught him somewhere in the side, and he rose from his</p>
<p>chair higher and higher, like old, gray, mad Nijinski, like Old faithful,</p>
<p>like some old nightmare of mine, to a phenomenal altitude, or so it seemed,</p>
<p>as he rent the air&#x2013;still shaking with the rich black music&#x2013;head thrown</p>
<p>back in a howl, hand pressed to his brow, and with his other hand clutching</p>
<p>his armpit as if stung by a hornet, down he came on his heels and, again a</p>
<p>normal robed man, scurried out into the hall.</p>
<p> I see myself following him through the hall, with a kind of double,</p>
<p>triple, kangaroo jump, remaining quite straight on straight legs while</p>
<p>bouncing up twice in his wake, and then bouncing between him and the front</p>
<p>door in a ballet-like stiff bounce, with the purpose of heading him off,</p>
<p>since the door was not properly closed.</p>
<p> Suddenly dignified, and somewhat morose, he started to walk up the</p>
<p>broad stairs, and, shifting my position, but not actually following him up</p>
<p>the steps, I fired three or four times in quick succession, wounding him at</p>
<p>every blaze; and every time I did it to him, that horrible thing to him, his</p>
<p>face would twitch in an absurd clownish manner, as if he were exaggerating</p>
<p>the pain; he slowed down, rolled his eyes half closing them and made a</p>
<p>feminine &#x201C;ah!&#x201D; and he shivered every time a bullet hit him as if I were</p>
<p>tickling him, and every time I got him with those slow, clumsy, blind</p>
<p>bullets of mine, he would say under his breath, with a phony British</p>
<p>accent&#x2013;all the while dreadfully twitching, shivering, smirking, but withal</p>
<p>talking in a curiously detached and even amiable manner: &#x201C;Ah, that hurts,</p>
<p>sir, enough! Ah, that hurts atrociously, my dear fellow. I pray you, desist.</p>
<p>Ah&#x2013;very painful, very painful, indeed . . . God! Hah! This is abominable,</p>
<p>you should really not&#x2013;&#x201D; His voice trailed off as he reached the landing,</p>
<p>but he steadily walked on despite all the lead I had lodged in his bloated</p>
<p>body&#x2013;and in distress, in dismay, I understood that far from killing him I</p>
<p>was injecting spurts of energy into the poor fellow, as if the bullets had</p>
<p>been capsules wherein a heady elixir danced.</p>
<p> I reloaded the thing with hands that were black and bloody&#x2013;I had</p>
<p>touched something he had anointed with his thick gore. Then I rejoined him</p>
<p>upstairs, the keys jangling in my pockets like gold.</p>
<p> He was trudging from room to room, bleeding majestically, trying to</p>
<p>find an open window, shaking his head, and still trying to talk me out of</p>
<p>murder. I took aim at his head, and he retired to the master bedroom with a</p>
<p>burst of royal purple where his ear had been.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Get out, get out of here,&#x201D; he said coughing and spitting; and in a</p>
<p>nightmare of wonder, I saw this blood-spattered but still buoyant person get</p>
<p>into his bed and wrap himself up in the chaotic bedclothes. I hit him at</p>
<p>very close range through the blankets, and then he lay back, and a big pink</p>
<p>bubble with juvenile connotations formed on his lips, grew to the size of a</p>
<p>toy balloon, and vanished.</p>
<p> I may have lost contact with reality for a second or two&#x2013;oh, nothing</p>
<p>of the I-just-blacked-out sort that your common criminal enacts; on the</p>
<p>contrary, I want to stress the fact that I was responsible for every shed</p>
<p>drop of his bubbleblood; but a kind of momentary shift occurred as if I were</p>
<p>in the connubial bedroom, and Charlotte were sick in bed. Quilty was a very</p>
<p>sick man. I held one of his slippers instead of the pistol&#x2013;I was sitting on</p>
<p>the pistol. Then I made myself a little more comfortable in the chair near</p>
<p>the bed, and consulted my wrist watch. The crystal was gone but it ticked.</p>
<p>The whole sad business had taken more than an hour. He was quiet at last.</p>
<p>Far from feeling any relief, a burden even weightier than the one I had</p>
<p>hoped to get rid of was with me, upon me, over me. I could not bring myself</p>
<p>to touch him in order to make sure he was really dead. He looked it: a</p>
<p>quarter of his face gone, and two flies beside themselves with a dawning</p>
<p>sense of unbelievable luck. My hands were hardly in better condition than</p>
<p>his. I washed up as best I could in the adjacent bathroom. Now I could</p>
<p>leave. As I emerged on the landing, I was amazed to discover that a</p>
<p>vivacious buzz I had just been dismissing as a mere singing in my ears was</p>
<p>really a medley of voices and radio music coming from the downstairs drawing</p>
<p>room.</p>
<p> I found there a number of people who apparently had just arrived and</p>
<p>were cheerfully drinking Quilty&#x2019;s liquor. There was a fat man in an easy</p>
<p>chair; and two dark-haired pale young beauties, sisters no doubt, big one</p>
<p>and small one (almost a child), demurely sat side by side on a davenport. A</p>
<p>florid-faced fellow with sapphire-blue eyes was in the act of bringing two</p>
<p>glasses out of the bar-like kitchen, where two or three women were chatting</p>
<p>and chinking ice. I stopped in the doorway and said: &#x201C;I have just killed</p>
<p>Clare Quilty.&#x201D; &#x201C;Good for you,&#x201D; said the florid fellow as he offered one of</p>
<p>the drinks to the elder girl. &#x201C;Somebody ought to have done it long ago,&#x201D;</p>
<p>remarked the fat man. &#x201C;What does he say, Tony?&#x201D; asked a faded blonde from</p>
<p>the bar. &#x201C;He says,&#x201D; answered the florid fellow, &#x201C;he has killed Cue.&#x201D; &#x201C;Well,&#x201D;</p>
<p>said another unidentified man rising in a corner where he had been crouching</p>
<p>to inspect some records, &#x201C;I guess we all should do it to him some day.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Anyway,&#x201D; said Tony, &#x201C;he&#x2019;d better come down. We can&#x2019;t wait for him much</p>
<p>longer if we want to go to that game.&#x201D; &#x201C;Give this man a drink somebody,&#x201D;</p>
<p>said the fat person. &#x201C;What a beer?&#x201D; said a woman in slacks, showing it to me</p>
<p>from afar.</p>
<p> Only the two girls on the davenport, both wearing black, the younger</p>
<p>fingering a bright something about her white neck, only they said nothing,</p>
<p>but just smiled on, so young, so lewd. As the music paused for a moment,</p>
<p>there was a sudden noise on the stairs. Tony and I stepped out into the</p>
<p>hall. Quilty of all people had managed to crawl out onto the landing, and</p>
<p>there we could see him, flapping and heaving, and then subsiding, forever</p>
<p>this time, in a purple heap.</p>
<p> &#x201C;Hurry up, Cue,&#x201D; said Tony with a laugh. &#x201C;I believe, he&#x2019;s still&#x2013;&#x201D; He</p>
<p>returned to the drawing room, music drowned the rest of the sentence.</p>
<p> This, I said to myself, was the end of the ingenious play staged for me</p>
<p>by Quilty. With a heavy heart I left the house and walked though the spotted</p>
<p>blaze of the sun to my car. Two other cars were parked on both sides of it,</p>
<p>and I had some trouble squeezing out.</p>
<p> 36</p>
<p> The rest is a little flattish and faded. Slowly I drove downhill, and</p>
<p>presently found myself going at the same lazy pace in a direction opposite</p>
<p>to Parkington. I had left my raincoat in the boudoir and Chum in the</p>
<p>bathroom. No, it was not a house I would have liked to live in. I wondered</p>
<p>idly if some surgeon of genius might not alter his own career, and perhaps</p>
<p>the whole destiny of mankind, by reviving quilted Quilty, Clare Obscure. Not</p>
<p>that I cared; on the whole I wished to forget the whole mess&#x2013;and when I did</p>
<p>learn he was dead, the only satisfaction it gave me, was the relief of</p>
<p>knowing I need not mentally accompany for months a painful and disgusting</p>
<p>convalescence interrupted by all kinds of unmentionable operations and</p>
<p>relapses, and perhaps an actual visit from him, with trouble on my part to</p>
<p>rationalize him as not being a ghost. Thomas had something. It is strange</p>
<p>that the tactile sense, which is so infinitely less precious to men than</p>
<p>sight, becomes at critical moment our main, if not only, handle to reality.</p>
<p>I was all covered with Quilty&#x2013;with the feel of that tumble before the</p>
<p>bleeding.</p>
<p> The road now stretched across open country, and it occurred to me&#x2013;not</p>
<p>by way of protest, not as a symbol, or anything like that, but merely as a</p>
<p>novel experience&#x2013;that since I had disregarded all laws of humanity, I might</p>
<p>as well disregard the rules of traffic. So I crossed to the left side of the</p>
<p>highway and checked the feeling, and the feeling was good. It was a pleasant</p>
<p>diaphragmal melting, with elements of diffused tactility, all this enhanced</p>
<p>by the thought that nothing could be nearer to the elimination of basic</p>
<p>physical laws than deliberately driving on the wrong side of the road. In a</p>
<p>way, it was a very spiritual itch. Gently, dreamily, not exceeding twenty</p>
<p>miles an hour, I drove on that queer mirror side. Traffic was light. Cars</p>
<p>that now and then passed me on the side I had abandoned to them, honked at</p>
<p>me brutally. Cars coming towards me wobbled, swerved, and cried out in fear.</p>
<p>Presently I found myself approaching populated places. Passing through a red</p>
<p>light was like a sip of forbidden Burgundy when I was a child. Meanwhile</p>
<p>complications were arising. I was being followed and escorted. Then in front</p>
<p>of me I saw two cars placing themselves in such a manner as to completely</p>
<p>block my way. With a graceful movement I turned off the road, and after two</p>
<p>or three big bounces, rode up a grassy slope, among surprised cows, and</p>
<p>there I came to a gentle rocking stop. A kind of thoughtful Hegelian</p>
<p>synthesis linking up two dead women.</p>
<p> I was soon to be taken out of the car (Hi, Melmoth, thanks a lot, old</p>
<p>fellow)&#x2013;and was, indeed, looking forward to surrender myself to many hands,</p>
<p>without doing anything to cooperate, while they moved and carried me,</p>
<p>relaxed, comfortable, surrendering myself lazily, like a patient, and</p>
<p>deriving an eerie enjoyment from my limpness and the absolutely reliable</p>
<p>support given me by the police and the ambulance people. And while I was</p>
<p>waiting for them to run up to me on the high slope, I evoked a last mirage</p>
<p>of wonder and hopelessness. One day, soon after her disappearance, an attack</p>
<p>of abominable nausea forced me to pull up on the ghost of an old mountain</p>
<p>road that now accompanied, now traversed a brand new highway, with its</p>
<p>population of asters bathing in the detached warmth of a pale-blue afternoon</p>
<p>in late summer. After coughing myself inside out, I rested a while on a</p>
<p>boulder, and then, thinking the sweet air might do me good, walked a little</p>
<p>way toward a low stone parapet on the precipice side of the highway. Small</p>
<p>grasshoppers spurted out of the withered roadside weeds. A very light cloud</p>
<p>was opening its arms and moving toward a slightly more substantial one</p>
<p>belonging to another, more sluggish, heavenlogged system. As I approached</p>
<p>the friendly abyss, I grew aware of a melodious unity of sounds rising like</p>
<p>vapor from a small mining town that lay at my feet, in a fold of the valley.</p>
<p>One could make out the geometry of the streets between blocks of red and</p>
<p>gray roofs, and green puffs of trees, and a serpentine stream, and the rich,</p>
<p>ore-like glitter of the city dump, and beyond the town, roads crisscrossing</p>
<p>the crazy quilt of dark and pale fields, and behind it all, great timbered</p>
<p>mountains. But even brighter than those quietly rejoicing colors&#x2013;for there</p>
<p>are colors and shades that seem to enjoy themselves in good company&#x2013;both</p>
<p>brighter and dreamier to the ear than they were to the eye, was that vapory</p>
<p>vibration of accumulated sounds that never ceased for a moment, as it rose</p>
<p>to the lip of granite where I stood wiping my foul mouth. And soon I</p>
<p>realized that all these sounds were of one nature, that no other sounds but</p>
<p>these came from the streets of the transparent town, with the women at home</p>
<p>and the men away. Reader! What I heard was but the melody of children at</p>
<p>play, nothing but that, and so limpid was the air that within this vapor of</p>
<p>blended voices, majestic and minute, remote and magically near, frank and</p>
<p>divinely enigmatic&#x2013;one could hear now and then, as if released, an almost</p>
<p>articulate spurt of vivid laughter, or the crack of a bat, or the clatter of</p>
<p>a toy wagon, but it was all really too far for the eye to distinguish any</p>
<p>movement in the lightly etched streets. I stood listening to that musical</p>
<p>vibration from my lofty slope, to those flashes of separate cries with a</p>
<p>kind of demure murmur for background, and then I knew that the hopelessly</p>
<p>poignant thing was not Lolita&#x2019;s absence from my side, but the absence of her</p>
<p>voice from that concord.</p>
<p> This then is my story. I have reread it. It has bits of marrow sticking</p>
<p>to it, and blood, and beautiful bright-green flies. At this or that twist of</p>
<p>it I feel my slippery self eluding me, gliding into deeper and darker waters</p>
<p>than I care to probe. I have camouflaged what I could so as not to hurt</p>
<p>people. And I have toyed with many pseudonyms for myself before I hit on a</p>
<p>particularly apt one. There are in my notes &#x201C;Otto Otto&#x201D; and &#x201C;Mesmer Mesmer&#x201D;</p>
<p>and &#x201C;Lambert Lambert,&#x201D; but for some reason I think my choice expresses the</p>
<p>nastiness best.</p>
<p> When I started, fifty-six days ago, to write Lolita, first in</p>
<p>the psychopathic ward for observation, and then in this well-heated, albeit</p>
<p>tombal, seclusion, I thought I would use these notes in toto at my trial, to</p>
<p>save not my head, of course, but my soul. In mind-composition, however, I</p>
<p>realized that I could not parade living Lolita. I still may use parts of</p>
<p>this memoir in hermetic sessions, but publication is to be deferred.</p>
<p> For reasons that may appear more obvious than they really are, I am</p>
<p>opposed to capital punishment; this attitude will be, I trust, shared by the</p>
<p>sentencing judge. Had I come before myself, I would have given Humbert at</p>
<p>least thirty-five years for rape, and dismissed the rest of the charges. But</p>
<p>even so, Dolly Schiller will probably survive me by many years. The</p>
<p>following decision I make with all the legal impact and support of a signed</p>
<p>testament: I wish this memoir to be published only when Lolita is no longer</p>
<p>alive.</p>
<p> Thus, neither of us is alive when the reader opens this book. But while</p>
<p>the blood still throbs through my writing hand, you are still as much part</p>
<p>of blessed matter as I am, and I can still talk to you from here to Alaska.</p>
<p>Be true to your Dick. Do not let other fellows touch you. Do not talk to</p>
<p>strangers. I hope you will love your baby. I hope it will be a boy. That</p>
<p>husband of yours, I hope, will always treat you well, because otherwise my</p>
<p>specter shall come at him, like black smoke, like a demented giant, and pull</p>
<p>him apart nerve by nerve. And do not pity C. Q. One had to choose between</p>
<p>him and H.H., and one wanted H.H. to exist at least a couple of months</p>
<p>longer, so as to have him make you live in the minds of later generations. I</p>
<p>am thinking of aurochs and angels, the secret of durable pigments, prophetic</p>
<p>sonnets, the refuge of art. And this is the only immortality you and I may</p>
<p>share, my Lolita.</p>
